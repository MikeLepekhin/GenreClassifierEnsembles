863,1660,A16,"The Slippery Rock Sliders were formed for the 2007 season to ensure an even number of teams with the Frontier League's addition of the Southern Illinois Miners . The Sliders played 32 home games at Jack Critchfield Park in Slippery Rock , Pennsylvania , with the remaining 64 played on the road . For the 2008 season , the Sliders became a traveling team , playing all of their games on the road under the geographical moniker , Midwest . The Sliders ' 2009 season began on May 29 , at Eastern Michigan University ' s Oestrike Stadium located in Ypsilanti , Michigan . The Sliders played strong - a 33-33 record after 66 games . However , countless injuries and the sale of top starting pitching led to a late-season slump . Pitcher James Albury was sold to the Chicago White Sox and pitcher Caleb Graham was sold to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim . The Sliders had 42 scheduled home dates with 54 scheduled road dates . The Oakland County Cruisers were scheduled move into Diamond at The Summit on July 16 , 2010 after playing three three-game series ( nine games total ) at Oestrike Stadium during the first half of the 2010 Frontier League season , however , the organization was unable to obtain funding in time for this to occur . The Cruisers played 78 of its 96 regular-season games on the road . The Cruisers led the Frontier League East for better than two months . However , the high amount of road games ( 30 more than any other team ) and the solid play of the Windy City Thunderbolts and Traverse City Beach Bums down the stretch led to a third-place finish - only four games out . Interim Manager Gera Alvarez won 2010 Frontier League Manager of the Year . Pitcher P.J. Zocchi and first baseman Joash Brodin were named to the Frontier League End-of-Year All-Star Team . Zocchi tied the Frontier League record for saves in a season with 26 ( matched Matt Petty of the Windy City Thunderbolts in 2007 ) and was named Frontier League Relief Pitcher of the Year . Construction on Diamond at The Summit was supposed to begin in October 2010 with the stadium completed in June 2011 . The complex would hold approximately 4,000 fans and function as a year-sound sports and entertainment complex in Waterford Township . After a groundbreaking ceremony with officials of Waterford Township , the area still sits as a vacant parking lot to the adjoining and vacant Summit Place Mall . A small sign touting the construction project sits on the corner of two shopping mall "" streets "" with fading color in a sea of weeds . The Sliders were Ypsilanti's first pro baseball team in nearly a century , since they were awarded a franchise in the Class D Border League in 1913 . The Border League was sometimes called a "" trolley league "" because its six franchises ( in southeastern Michigan and Ontario , Canada ) were located on the interurban lines ; they played a limited schedule of games , primarily on weekends . Managed by former major-leaguer Ducky Pearce , the unnamed Ypsilanti team took the pennant with a 24-10 record , then folded with the rest of the league . Ypsilanti thus held the distinction of being one of the few cities to win a championship in its only season hosting a pro ballclub . College baseball remains popular in Ypsilanti : Eastern Michigan University won a NAIA national championship in 1971 and made it all the way to the championship game of the NCAA College World Series in 1976 before losing to Arizona . The Hurons ( now Eagles ) remain the last northern school to play for the CWS title . </doc>

206,1624,A12,"Los Angeles TMJ pain relief a joint effort The joints at the back of the jaw are used in every oral activity . These joints slide from side to side to facilitate chewing and speaking . They open and close , and move forward and back to facilitate breathing as well . Under certain circumstances , such as tooth grinding or clenching , the temporomandibular joints , and the muscles that surround them , can become dysfunctional . For some , the symptoms of TMJ disorder are mild , and disappear within a few weeks . However , there are people for whom TMJ becomes chronic , often gradually worsening . We encourage our Los Angeles area patients to seek TMJ pain relief with a combination of self-care and professional treatment with a customized oral appliance . Steps that can be taken at home include : Applying both heat and ice , alternating between the two . Moist heat can alleviate pain and increase function of irritated joints and muscles . Periodic application of ice packs promotes decrease inflammation and slightly numbing sore muscles , while heat packs increase circulation and promotes healing . Neither heat nor ice should be applied directly to skin . Instead , wrap in a thin towel and keep it on for no more than 15 minutes at a time . Discomfort from TMJ disorder can be reduced with over the counter anti-inflammatory medication . These should not take the place of other remedies , which are aimed at relieving pressure and undue stress on affected joints . If symptoms do not improve with over the counter medication , it is best to contact our office for professional treatment . Learning to relax specific muscles . Part of the issue with TMJ disorder is tension . You can learn to relax the muscles of the face , neck , and shoulders to decrease symptoms and provide rest for the jaw . Specifically , train yourself to fall into a relaxed state where teeth are apart and lips are loose . Downtown Dental has the expertise and technology to treat TMJ disorder in a non-invasive manner . With a customized oral appliance prescribed for wear at night , we encourage the proper positioning of the jaw and bring end to uncomfortable symptoms . </doc>

794,89,A1,"The Free Software Definition We maintain this free software definition to show clearly what must be true about a particular software program for it to be considered free software . From time to time we revise this definition to clarify it . If you would like to review the changes we 've made , please see the History section below for more information . "" Free software "" is a matter of liberty , not price . To understand the concept , you should think of "" free "" as in "" free speech , "" not as in "" free beer . "" Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run , copy , distribute , study , change and improve the software . More precisely , it means that the program's users have the four essential freedoms : • The freedom to run the program , for any purpose ( freedom 0 ) . • The freedom to study how the program works , and change it so it does your computing as you wish ( freedom 1 ) . Access to the source code is a precondition for this . • The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor ( freedom 2 ) . • The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others ( freedom 3 ) . By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes . Access to the source code is a precondition for this . A program is free software if users have all of these freedoms . Thus , you should be free to redistribute copies , either with or without modifications , either gratis or charging a fee for distribution , to anyone anywhere . Being free to do these things means ( among other things ) that you do not have to ask or pay for permission to do so . You should also have the freedom to make modifications and use them privately in your own work or play , without even mentioning that they exist . If you do publish your changes , you should not be required to notify anyone in particular , or in any particular way . The freedom to run the program means the freedom for any kind of person or organization to use it on any kind of computer system , for any kind of overall job and purpose , without being required to communicate about it with the developer or any other specific entity . In this freedom , it is the user's purpose that matters , not the developer's purpose ; you as a user are free to run the program for your purposes , and if you distribute it to someone else , she is then free to run it for her purposes , but you are not entitled to impose your purposes on her . The freedom to redistribute copies must include binary or executable forms of the program , as well as source code , for both modified and unmodified versions . ( Distributing programs in runnable form is necessary for conveniently installable free operating systems . ) It is OK if there is no way to produce a binary or executable form for a certain program ( since some languages do n't support that feature ) , but you must have the freedom to redistribute such forms should you find or develop a way to make them . In order for freedoms 1 and 3 ( the freedom to make changes and the freedom to publish improved versions ) to be meaningful , you must have access to the source code of the program . Therefore , accessibility of source code is a necessary condition for free software . Obfuscated "" source code "" is not real source code and does not count as source code . Freedom 1 includes the freedom to use your changed version in place of the original . If the program is delivered in a product designed to run someone else 's modified versions but refuse to run yours – a practice known as "" tivoization "" or "" lockdown "" , or ( in its practitioners' perverse terminology ) as "" secure boot "" – freedom 1 becomes a theoretical fiction rather than a practical freedom . This is not sufficient . In other words , these binaries are not free software even if the source code they are compiled from is free . One important way to modify a program is by merging in available free subroutines and modules . If the program's license says that you can not merge in a suitably licensed existing module – for instance , if it requires you to be the copyright holder of any code you add – then the license is too restrictive to qualify as free . Freedom 3 includes the freedom to release your modified versions as free software . A free license may also permit other ways of releasing them ; in other words , it does not have to be a copyleft license . However , a license that requires modified versions to be nonfree does not qualify as a free license . In order for these freedoms to be real , they must be permanent and irrevocable as long as you do nothing wrong ; if the developer of the software has the power to revoke the license , or retroactively change its terms , without your doing anything wrong to give cause , the software is not free . However , certain kinds of rules about the manner of distributing free software are acceptable , when they do n't conflict with the central freedoms . For example , copyleft ( very simply stated ) is the rule that when redistributing the program , you can not add restrictions to deny other people the central freedoms . This rule does not conflict with the central freedoms ; rather it protects them . "" Free software "" does not mean "" noncommercial . "" A free program must be available for commercial use , commercial development , and commercial distribution . Commercial development of free software is no longer unusual ; such free commercial software is very important . You may have paid money to get copies of free software , or you may have obtained copies at no charge . But regardless of how you got your copies , you always have the freedom to copy and change the software , even to sell copies . Whether a change constitutes an improvement is a subjective matter . If your modifications are limited , in substance , to changes that someone else considers an improvement , that is not freedom . However , rules about how to package a modified version are acceptable , if they do n't substantively limit your freedom to release modified versions , or your freedom to make and use modified versions privately . Thus , it is acceptable for the license to require that you change the name of the modified version , remove a logo , or identify your modifications as yours . As long as these requirements are not so burdensome that they effectively hamper you from releasing your changes , they are acceptable ; you 're already making other changes to the program , so you wo n ' t have trouble making a few more . Rules that "" if you make your version available in this way , you must make it available in that way also "" can be acceptable too , on the same condition . An example of such an acceptable rule is one saying that if you have distributed a modified version and a previous developer asks for a copy of it , you must send one . ( Note that such a rule still leaves you the choice of whether to distribute your version at all . ) Rules that require release of source code to the users for versions that you put into public use are also acceptable . In the GNU project , we use copyleft to protect these freedoms legally for everyone . But noncopylefted free software also exists . We believe there are important reasons why it is better to use copyleft , but if your program is noncopylefted free software , it is still basically ethical . ( See Categories of Free Software for a description of how "" free software , "" "" copylefted software "" and other categories of software relate to each other . ) Sometimes government export control regulations and trade sanctions can constrain your freedom to distribute copies of programs internationally . Software developers do not have the power to eliminate or override these restrictions , but what they can and must do is refuse to impose them as conditions of use of the program . In this way , the restrictions will not affect activities and people outside the jurisdictions of these governments . Thus , free software licenses must not require obedience to any export regulations as a condition of any of the essential freedoms . Most free software licenses are based on copyright , and there are limits on what kinds of requirements can be imposed through copyright . If a copyright-based license respects freedom in the ways described above , it is unlikely to have some other sort of problem that we never anticipated ( though this does happen occasionally ) . However , some free software licenses are based on contracts , and contracts can impose a much larger range of possible restrictions . That means there are many possible ways such a license could be unacceptably restrictive and nonfree . We ca n ' t possibly list all the ways that might happen . If a contract-based license restricts the user in an unusual way that copyright-based licenses can not , and which is n't mentioned here as legitimate , we will have to think about it , and we will probably conclude it is nonfree . When talking about free software , it is best to avoid using terms like "" give away "" or "" for free , "" because those terms imply that the issue is about price , not freedom . Some common terms such as "" piracy "" embody opinions we hope you wo n ' t endorse . See Confusing Words and Phrases that are Worth Avoiding for a discussion of these terms . We also have a list of proper translations of "" free software "" into various languages . Finally , note that criteria such as those stated in this free software definition require careful thought for their interpretation . To decide whether a specific software license qualifies as a free software license , we judge it based on these criteria to determine whether it fits their spirit as well as the precise words . If a license includes unconscionable restrictions , we reject it , even if we did not anticipate the issue in these criteria . Sometimes a license requirement raises an issue that calls for extensive thought , including discussions with a lawyer , before we can decide if the requirement is acceptable . When we reach a conclusion about a new issue , we often update these criteria to make it easier to see why certain licenses do or do n't qualify . If you are interested in whether a specific license qualifies as a free software license , see our list of licenses . If the license you are concerned with is not listed there , you can ask us about it by sending us email at < licensing@gnu.org > . If you are contemplating writing a new license , please contact the Free Software Foundation first by writing to that address . The proliferation of different free software licenses means increased work for users in understanding the licenses ; we may be able to help you find an existing free software license that meets your needs . If that is n't possible , if you really need a new license , with our help you can ensure that the license really is a free software license and avoid various practical problems . Beyond Software Software manuals must be free , for the same reasons that software must be free , and because the manuals are in effect part of the software . The same arguments also make sense for other kinds of works of practical use – that is to say , works that embody useful knowledge , such as educational works and reference works . Wikipedia is the best-known example . Any kind of work can be free , and the definition of free software has been extended to a definition of free cultural works applicable to any kind of works . Open Source ? Another group has started using the term "" open source "" to mean something close ( but not identical ) to "" free software . "" We prefer the term "" free software "" because , once you have heard that it refers to freedom rather than price , it calls to mind freedom . The word "" open "" never refers to freedom . </doc>

397,1408,A4,"Recap – Burn Notice 4.03 "" Made Man "" This episode of Burn Notice starts where we expect to see our spies have a meeting .... a bar . Sam and Fiona begin to argue that Jesse is not fit for their team while Michael gives him the benefit of the doubt . Jesse shows up during the argument with drinks and soon changes Sams mind about being on the team . Jesse begins to talk to the others about why he came to Miami and tells them that he has information about some illegal weapons trade but his only source on this is from a person he calls "" Cobra "" . Sam is not enthused by the name . Michael decides that maybe this is worth investigating . The gang arrives at the dock to scope out what exactly they are dealing with . They find it is tough to get any info from any of the dock workers about where the ships with the weapons have come from . While talking with Fiona and Michael , Jesse notices a dock security guard getting beat up . He says he has seen this before and wants to finally end this . Michael tells Jesse it 's not worth blowing cover to help a civilian . Jesse does n't listen and goes over to help . Through a fake car accident story , Jesse gets the security guard to safety and disarms the two men who were beating up the guard . Michael and Fiona find Jesse talking with Hank ( security guard ) . Hank tells them that the men who attacked him work for the mob and have been pressuring him and other guards to steal items from containers at the dock . Hank says the police have no effect , as one guard who went to the police was soon murdered . Jesse quickly wants to help out and Michael reluctantly decides to make Hank the new client . While walking to the car , Michael berates Jesse for his fast acting with no planning style of work and Michael believes that Hank is being put at risk while he is being helped by the spies . Jesse disagrees . Not wanting to argue , Michael decides the best way to attack the situation is to get some information on the mob they are dealing with . Cut to a bar downtown , Sam shows Michael the information he obtained from a "" police buddy "" on mob members in Miami . The bar turns out to be the mobs place to drink . Michael is surprised to see a mob bar look so normal . We see a man come walking out of the bar and Sam informs Michael this is Tony Carro , a mob boss who runs some business in Florida for a mob in New York . Sam quickly runs through Tonys profile and sees that Tony's record is for the most part clean . Back at the Westen house , Jesse and Michaels Mother , Madeline , are cooking up some food . Madeline remarks that she knows nothing about Jesse . She makes observations that Jesse must have been a government worker as he never parks his car in the same place and always exits the house through a different door . Michael enters the house and Jesse tells Madeline that Michael is there for him . Madeline leaves slightly angry . The two men begin to talk about the plan to take down the mob in Miami . In Michael's apartment , Michael begins creating a listening device out of gum , a tissue , and some lint ( Michael , in a voice-over , states that the best "" bug "" is something that people do n't want to touch ) . Sam enters with an alias for Michael to use during the plan . The identity he is using is a suspended FBI agent named Ned Gorden . Sam has everything that Michael needs to assume the identity , to which Michael seems very pleased . We next see Michael getting escorted into the mob bar to see Tony . Before talking to Michael , Tony is yelling at a store owner who is selling the stolen merchandise Tony gets . The owner is late on some money and Tony is threatening to kill him if not payed back . Before leaving , the owner agrees to pay by the afternoon . Michael is brought in to see Tony . Tony states he has seen Michael standing outside for many days . Michael asks Tony how much info on Tony would be worth if Michael told others . Michael is thrown to the table and it 's there Tonys guard pulls out Michael's fake FBI badge . Michael creates the cover story as being a drunk . Tony agrees to meet with Michael at 4 : 00 . Before leaving , Tony tells Michael to never return to the bar again . Cut to the underside of a bridge . Michael is waiting for Tony to show up while Jesse and Fiona keep watch . We see two men approach , but neither of them are Tony . One of the men explains that they know Michael is not Agent Gorden and the men begin to attack Michael . Fiona and Jesse argue over taking a shot to kill or not kill the men .

766,223,A8,"Twelfth report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Introduction The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution 1417 ( 2002 ) of 14 June 2002 , by which the Council decided to extend the mandate of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUC ) until 30 June 2003 and to review progress every four months on the basis of reports of the Secretary-General . It describes developments until 11 October 2002 , since my report of 5 June ( S / 2002 / 621 ) and the special report ( S / 2002 / 1005 ) which I submitted to the Council on 10 September 2002 , following the agreements concluded recently in Pretoria and Luanda between the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Governments of Rwanda and Uganda , respectively . Political developments The period under review witnessed a number of significant political and military developments , in particular the signing of the bilateral agreements in Pretoria and Luanda , and the troop withdrawals undertaken by Angola , Burundi , Rwanda , Uganda and Zimbabwe ( see paras . These developments occurred while consultations among the Congolese parties on the establishment of a transitional government continued . Inter-Congolese dialogue The initial round of consultations among the signatories of the agreement concluded at Sun City , on the sidelines of the inter-Congolese dialogue , commenced at Matadi , Democratic Republic of the Congo , in May . The talks , which ended on 6 July , highlighted serious differences between the Mouvement de libération du Congo ( MLC ) and the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo concerning , in particular , the power-sharing arrangements for the Supreme Council of Defence and the procedure for designating the Prime Minister . In August , however , the participants reached agreement on the 167 articles of the transitional constitution . At my request , my Special Envoy , Moustapha Niasse , undertook an exploratory mission to the region from 13 to 30 June 2002 to ascertain the possibility of helping the Congolese parties to reach an all-inclusive political agreement . The Special Envoy began his mission in Lusaka and Addis Ababa , where he met the Chairman and the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity . He then visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo for discussions with President Joseph Kabila , Jean-Pierre Bemba of MLC and the leadership of the Rassemblement congolais pour la démocratie ( RCD ) - Goma . In Kinshasa , and later in Matadi , the Special Envoy met with political parties , representatives of civil society , and some armed groups . Subsequently , the Special Envoy visited Sir Ketumile Masire , the facilitator of the inter-Congolese dialogue , in Gaborone , as well as the Presidents of Gabon , Rwanda , South Africa and Zimbabwe , and the Foreign Minister of Angola , in their respective capitals . My Special Envoy's interlocutors stressed the need to reach an all-inclusive agreement and expressed their readiness to continue informal discussions under his auspices , on the understanding that any agreement reached informally would then have to be endorsed by the inter-Congolese dialogue . During the second phase of his mission , from 9 July to 17 August , the Special Envoy discussed with his Congolese interlocutors their views pertaining to power-sharing during the transition and , in particular , the structure of the transitional institutions and the distribution of responsibilities among the various State organs . He asked them to base their proposals in this regard on the objectives and principles agreed upon at Sun City . On 3 September , my Special Envoy started the third phase of his mission . The Government and the RCD-Goma delegations , which have been meeting in Pretoria since mid-September , seem to have reached a common understanding on a government structure and power-sharing formula . MLC has clarified its position in this regard and has had bilateral consultations with the Government and other parties . On 2 October , some representatives of the political opposition and civil society held consultations in Pretoria under the auspices of the Government of South Africa . My Special Envoy believes that the Congolese parties are close to reaching a political settlement acceptable to all . Developments in the wake of the Pretoria and Luanda agreements My special report on MONUC provided information on the withdrawal of foreign forces from the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Since then , the Ugandan withdrawal has continued and all Uganda People's Defence Forces personnel , numbering 2,287 , with the exception of a reinforced battalion stationed at Bunia and troops patrolling the western slopes of the Ruwenzori Mountains , have now withdrawn from the country . The Zimbabwe Defence Forces have also continued to withdraw . The total number of their repatriated forces as at 11 October was 3,477 . A small number of Angolan military forces withdrew at the same time . In addition , it was reported that , as at 11 October , 700 troops of the Forces armées burundaises had been withdrawn from the country . Most significant has been the withdrawal of the Rwandan Patriotic Army ( RPA ) , which commenced on 17 September . According to information verified by MONUC , as at 11 October , the total number of RPA forces withdrawn from the Democratic Republic of the Congo stood at 20,941 . The withdrawal , which began in Kindu / Kalima , was subsequently extended to the remainder of Maniema Province , as well as to Katanga and North and South Kivu . There were withdrawals from a total of 32 positions in the east . The troops transited through 21 assembly areas and reached entry points into Rwanda at Cyangugu , Bugarama , Gisenyi and Kanombe Airport , Kigali . MONUC observers were present at most of the 21 RPA assembly sites and at all exit points , where detailed certificates were prepared and signed by MONUC , as well as at entry points into Rwanda , where the numbers were again cross-checked . RPA has claimed that a total of 23,760 troops had been withdrawn . MONUC therefore asked for a formal explanation of the resulting discrepancy of 2,819 . MONUC has received some unconfirmed reports that RPA forces may have entered the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , particularly around the Bukavu area , before the present withdrawal began , and that RPA may have left significant amounts of weaponry , as well as some of its personnel , with RCD-Goma . MONUC intends to verify these reports and to revisit those areas from which foreign forces have been withdrawn , in an effort to verify , together with the third-party verification mechanism , that all RPA troops in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been repatriated . A thorough investigation may also require visiting the present locations of the withdrawn troops in the home countries . As mentioned in my special report , the third-party verification mechanism has successfully begun its activities . Its terms of reference were finalized and its procedures of work further developed . The mechanism has verified the departure of the declared RPA troops at various departure and arrival points . Prior to the withdrawal of those troops , the mechanism met with expert groups from the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda , in Kinshasa and Kigali respectively , to discuss the implementation of the Pretoria Agreement . As the withdrawal of foreign forces proceeded , the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 24 September declared all political leaders of the Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda ( FDLR ) persona non grata , and ordered them to leave the country within 72 hours . FDLR had claimed leadership of many of the ex-FAR / Interahamwe elements in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , including those cantoned in Kamina . The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo was criticized by the Government of Rwanda and RCD-Goma for not handing over the FDLR leaders to the International Tribunal for Rwanda . The Prosecutor of the Tribunal announced , however , that none of the FDLR leaders were on the list of those indicted by the Tribunal . Eight members of FDLR left the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 2 October for Brazzaville , but they were arrested there by local authorities and deported back to Kinshasa the same day . They have since been held at the port of Kinshasa by the immigration authorities , pending further negotiations between the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo . In another significant development , Tharcisse Renzaho , the former préfet of Kigali , who is on the list of those indicted by the Tribunal , was arrested on 29 September in Kinshasa and transferred to Arusha . Situation in the north-east During the last three months , the overall security conditions in the north-eastern town of Bunia and the entire Ituri region have continued to deteriorate . There have been recurrent ethnic clashes since June , when the Union des patriotes congolais ( UPC ) , a primarily Hema militia , was reinforced and resupplied . On 10 July 2002 , following intense fighting between UPC and RCD-ML troops in the centre of the city , the governor and RCD-ML authorities fled to Beni , leaving Bunia in the hands of the militia . In mid-August , UPC continued its offensive and succeeded in capturing some of the district's important towns , such as Irumu , 80 km from Bunia on the road to Beni . The violence and the resulting displacement of the population have deepened the mistrust among the communities of Ituri , which is also related to the distribution of resources , as well as manipulation by both internal and external actors . After the signing on 18 April of the Sun City agreement , the Government sought to restore State authority in Ituri through cooperation with RCD-K / ML . The Government dispatched officials to Bunia and Kampala , in order to define the conditions for the extension of its administration and to discuss a timetable for the withdrawal of Ugandan troops . The reactions of the local factions varied , UPC , in particular , expressing its strong opposition to the proposed restoration of State administration . Subsequent events in the region , including the incident in which the Government's Minister for Human Rights was taken hostage , were covered in my special report . Increased violence in the Isiro region ( Province Orientale ) has also been sparked by the advance of RCD-N towards , and its occupation of , Faradje , Watsa and Nia Nia in territory formerly controlled by RCD-K / ML . MLC has reportedly reinforced and supported RCD-N with equipment , ammunition and personnel . The armed elements of the two organizations share the same name , Armée de libération du Congo ( ALC ) . Their activities seem to be driven in part by a desire for territorial strength as negotiations towards an all-inclusive transitional government progress . At the same time , there are indications that the Government is providing material support to RCD-K / ML , and that RCD-N is forging links with UPC . Situation in the Hauts Plateaux and South Kivu In the Hauts Plateaux area , to the north-west of Lake Tanganyika , RPA and RCD-Goma operations continued against the Banyamulenge group of Patrick Masunzu , which broke away from RCD-Goma earlier in the year . Prior to the initiation of the RPA withdrawal , there were indications that the bulk of this fighting was being conducted by RPA . From mid-August to mid-September , RPA captured some key airstrips , in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which it alleged were being used by the Government to deliver supplies to armed groups fighting RPA . In reaction to the growing popularity of Commander Masunzu , RCD-Goma "" purged "" some of its members suspected of siding with the Banyamulenge rebellion , in an effort to halt popular support for the movement in South Kivu . On 7 June , during a meeting in Bukavu , the President of RCD-Goma , Adolphe Onusumba , called for the formation of a "" unified front "" against the military operations led by Commander Masunzu . Subsequently , the reinforcement of RPA troops in the Uvira sector indicated that Rwanda might continue to feel threatened by the military resistance of Commander Masunzu and his supporters . However , the situation in the area is now reported to have changed with the withdrawal of RPA forces . According to unconfirmed reports , troops led by Commander Masunzu have reassumed control of the Hauts Plateaux region . Kindu In July , the population in Kindu and in the adjacent village of Alunguli reported outbreaks of intense violence as a result of fighting between RCD-Goma and the Mayi-Mayi . Subsequently , RCD-Goma troops reinforced Kindu and the RCD-Goma Deputy Chief of Staff assumed control over the movement's operations in the area . RCD-Goma subsequently launched an offensive from Kindu to drive Mayi-Mayi elements out of the region . Well-organized and equipped Mayi-Mayi launched limited but effective counter-attacks . Reports were received of indiscriminate killing of civilians in the course of the fighting , including at Kitongi where some 80 people , mostly women and children , were reportedly burned alive . In the wake of the RPA withdrawal from Kindu and Kalima , violence erupted on 19 September in Kindu town with a firefight between RCD-Goma and the Mayi-Mayi . While the violence subsided that same day with the mediation of MONUC , two Mayi-Mayi activists took refuge on MONUC premises in Kindu for a number of days . RCD-Goma , which made several public statements against MONUC , including specific threats by its President against United Nations personnel , remains in control of Kindu . On 21 September , RCD-Goma troops reportedly engaged in a number of targeted killings of suspected Mayi-Mayi supporters in the area . While the situation remains tense in Kindu , relations between MONUC and RCD-Goma have somewhat improved . Activities of the Mission and the United Nations in support of the peace process Military During the reporting period , MONUC continued to monitor and verify the new defensive positions of the parties , in accordance with its phase II mandate . It also continued to prepare for phase III activities . MONUC currently has some 90 military observer teams located at 50 sites ; 25 of these teams are mobile and available for deployment on a range of monitoring and verifying activities . In addition , 3,590 armed troops are protecting MONUC sector headquarters , logistic bases and coordination centres in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . MONUC therefore has a total of 4,258 military personnel , against a mandated ceiling of 5,537 ( see annex ) . The situation along the disengagement line remains generally stable . While a few positions continue to be occupied in contravention of the disengagement and redeployment plan , the Sun City agreement has had a positive effect on the status of the MLC / RCD-Goma and FAC separation line . The only major violation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement during the reporting period occurred in Pweto in June . The village , occupied by RCD-Goma authorities in violation of the Lusaka Agreement , was taken over by a group of Mayi-Mayi . A subsequent meeting of the Joint Military Commission in Kinshasa concluded with a joint communiqué indicating that the location should be handed over to the Government . However , on 29 June , RCD-Goma recaptured Pweto and remains there now . In Kisangani , following an incident in June when the local RCD-Goma Brigade Commander assaulted MONUC military guards at the Onatra port facility , MONUC has worked actively with local authorities to reduce tension and has stepped up patrols by its military observers . On 8 October , however , MONUC personnel , caught in a demonstration against RCD-Goma , were slightly injured and their vehicles burned . MONUC troops assisting at the scene were compelled to shoot in the air to disperse demonstrators surrounding them . The demonstration was apparently triggered by an alleged robbery attempt and assault by RCD-Goma elements on a university professor . As planning for phase III develops , MONUC is identifying and progressively establishing additional observation sites in the east , in order to create the conditions for future disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration operations and to monitor and verify the withdrawal of foreign forces from the country ( as noted in para . To this end , and subject to security conditions , MONUC plans to deploy military observer teams to Punia , Kalima , Shabunda , Walikale , Baraka , Bunyakiri , Kamituga and Lubutu in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo . At the same time , teams will be deployed to Lubumbashi and Kamina in Government-controlled territory , to verify reports of ex-FAR / Interahamwe presence in those areas and to monitor the airfields allegedly used to resupply armed groups in the east . In the meantime United Nations riverine operations continued , allowing MONUC to escort resupply and humanitarian relief barges . Consequently , the first commercial barge convoy in four years , accompanied by MONUC vessels , was dispatched from Kinshasa to Lisala and Bumba on 20 July ( see paras . 36 and 37 ) . Disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration With the conclusion of the Pretoria Agreement on 30 July , the ongoing withdrawal of foreign forces and the easing of political obstacles to the process of disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration , MONUC is refining its comprehensive strategy for this process , in cooperation with the United Nations agencies and international actors involved . This ongoing activity has been given further impetus by the increasing willingness of the Government to address the political obstacles underlying successful disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration , as well as reports by MONUC that several small to medium-sized groups of ex-FAR / Interahamwe may be considering participating in the process . MONUC intends to continue to implement ad hoc disarmament , demobilization and repatriation operations , pending deployment of the two task forces to be based in Kindu and Kisangani , as recommended in the special report ( S / 2002 / 1005 ) . In this connection , the French Ambassador in Kinshasa has recently announced his Government's intention to make available 1 million euros for disarmament , demobilization and repatriation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , for both Congolese and foreign armed groups . Since my eleventh report , MONUC has established a disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration presence in Goma , Bukavu and Butembo . Plans are under way for a similar presence in Kamina , Lubumbashi and possibly Shabunda to implement the process in an ad hoc way in those areas . Despite existing security constraints and the difficulties in accessing the armed groups , MONUC will continue to explore the possibility of opening additional offices and sites for reception centres in the east of the country . On 30 September , a first group of 69 Rwandan ex-combatants and 10 civilians left Kamina , where they had been cantoned by the Government , on an exploratory visit to Rwanda . MONUC had earlier succeeded in completing an initial screening of 1,981 combatants at Kamina in December 2001 , but could not complete their demobilization because of their refusal to provide the necessary information concerning personal identification and military background . The exploratory visit has clearly been facilitated by the signature of the Pretoria Agreement and the banning of FDLR , which was opposed to attempts to repatriate the ex-combatants . The group , which was accompanied by MONUC personnel and by South African representatives of the Third Party Verification Mechanism , was flown to Rwanda on MONUC aircraft and spent some 10 days in Kigali and their home communes . MONUC is following up on this exploratory visit with a view to repatriating all the ex-combatants at Kamina . In July , a MONUC disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration team in Beni demobilized Rwandan combatants among a small group of 46 persons , which included dependants and Congolese citizens , who had already been disarmed by the local RCD-K / ML authorities . Although the combatants agreed to be demobilized , they were reluctant to be repatriated . Accordingly , at the invitation of MONUC , the Government of Rwanda sent a team to persuade the ex-combatants to return home . Only eight have returned , however , although other members of the group now appear willing to consider repatriation . In July , MONUC held consultations with the Government of Uganda and the Ugandan Amnesty Commission , concerning a process of disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration for 300 to 400 Allied Democratic Front ( ADF ) combatants present in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Provided that the security situation around Bunia does not deteriorate , this operation is expected to commence soon . It is to be conducted under the overall supervision of the Ugandan Amnesty Commission and MONUC , in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration and a Ugandan non-governmental organization , with the support of UNICEF and WFP . The Donor Technical Group on Uganda , which consists of prominent international donors , has agreed to finance the operation , in which the role of MONUC will be limited to disarming and demobilizing the ADF combatants in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . In the meantime , MONUC has undertaken efforts to further mainstream disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration within the Mission by intensifying internal consultation in the planning of future such operations during phase III . Such planning takes into account the recent political developments , such as the Pretoria Agreement , lessons learned from previous exercises of this kind conducted by other peacekeeping operations , and the Mission's experience in Kamina and Beni . As indicated in my special report , MONUC has established a Joint Coordination Committee for disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration and has continued its consultations with United Nations agencies , the World Bank and the diplomatic community , in order to refine the division of labour in respect of these operations and to transform the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration concept into a joint operational plan . In this context , the cooperation of MONUC with the World Bank is crucial . The World Bank has initiated activities under the Multi-Country Demobilization and Reintegration Programme for the Greater Great Lakes Region , which is designed to support the consolidation of peace in the region . The Programme was established to provide financial and technical assistance to national programmes , regional initiatives and special projects within the framework defined by the greater Great Lakes regional strategy for demobilization and reintegration endorsed by nine countries involved in , or affected by , conflicts in the region , as well as 30 partners from regional organizations , donor countries , international financial institutions and relevant United Nations agencies . Through the Multi-Country Programme , the World Bank and partners will be working closely with national Governments , as they are doing now with the Government of Rwanda , in preparation for reintegration programmes for returning ex-combatants from the Democratic Republic of the Congo . MONUC is collaborating closely with the World Bank to ensure that the process beginning with disarmament and demobilization of ex-combatants in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , for which MONUC will be responsible under the proposed assessed budget arrangements , continues seamlessly towards reintegration of the same groups in Rwanda , where the Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Programme , funded by the Multi-Country Programme , would assist former combatants in their transition to civilian life . Most recently , MONUC participated in a seminar conducted by the Bank in Nairobi from 17 to 21 September 2002 to facilitate dialogue between the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda with regard to the technical aspects of the implementation of the Pretoria Agreement . The seminar identified in some detail the main activities to be performed during the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration operations , indicating where the responsibility for performing them lay . MONUC is mandated only to disarm , demobilize and repatriate the foreign armed groups listed in the Lusaka Agreement . However , circumstances might arise when Congolese groups or individuals might present themselves at a MONUC reception centre , to surrender their weapons in the hope of becoming eligible for some sort of national Congolese demobilization and reinsertion programme . Bearing in mind the responsibility it might be considered to have incurred in agreeing to disarm men in such circumstances , MONUC has also been consulting with specialized agencies and donors about steps it could take , within its mandate and resources , to facilitate their subsequent demobilization and reinsertion . A working arrangement on the ground with the participation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , MONUC and UNDP is being considered , for example , to assist with the disarmament , demobilization and reinsertion of Congolese armed groups into society . Reopening of the Congo River There were hopes that significant progress could be achieved towards the reopening of the Congo River after the signature in May of an agreement between the three main parties under the auspices of MONUC . On 20 July , 12 barges set off from Kinshasa to Lisala and Bumba ( northern Equateur ) in the first attempt to resume commercial exchanges in nearly four years . A further commercial convoy of four barges left Kinshasa on 8 October . This will be joined en route by at least four additional barges . In Kisangani , the RCD-Goma authorities continue to insist on convening a tripartite committee meeting to discuss "" technical issues "" with the Government and MLC before lifting all restrictions on river traffic . This demand reflects a disagreement between RCD-Goma and the business community in Kisangani over taxes . MONUC is actively trying to bring the concerned parties together to settle their differences . In the meantime , the slow progress towards an agreement between the three main parties continues to pose a serious threat to the restoration of the freedom of movement of people and goods on the river . Civilian police MONUC is preparing a detailed plan in regard to possible expansion of civilian police activities to meet the rapidly changing circumstances on the ground , especially in the light of the Pretoria and Luanda agreements . There are currently 52 United Nations civilian police officers deployed in Kinshasa , Kisangani and Goma . In accordance with Security Council resolution 1376 ( 2001 ) , the civilian police component is in the process of implementing a pilot project for training the local police in Kisangani . The programme includes a refresher course for already existing police units , and specialized training for traffic and court police , as well as for criminal investigators . The latter comprises training for police cadets , and an advanced training course for police inspectors . As part of the programme , MONUC will proceed , as soon as possible , and in cooperation with bilateral donors , with the refurbishment of the police training centre in Kapalata , as well as the procurement of basic materials such as uniforms , vehicles and communication equipment , through the special trust fund established by the Mission for this purpose . The first session of the short-term "" train-the-trainers "" course in Kisangani was concluded on 31 August and a second session was completed on 15 October . A refresher course for judicial police is to begin on 21 October . Public information Public information deployment and activities have reinforced the visibility of MONUC in all sectors of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Radio Okapi broadcasts news programmes in five languages from Kinshasa to eight locations : Kisangani , Goma , Kalemie , Kananga , Mbandaka , Gbadolite , Kindu and , as from 6 October , Bukavu . These eight regional FM stations have also commenced locally produced programming . Three short wave transmitters have been installed in Kinshasa and will be fully operational by the end of October , covering the entire country and the region . Radio Okapi has started an information campaign on disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration with specific programmes in French , Swahili and Kinyarwanda targeting both the armed groups and the Congolese population . United Nations agencies have also increased their contributions to Radio Okapi programming . During the reporting period the publication information component of MONUC has produced 60,000 posters and 50,000 bumper stickers in five languages ; these are being disseminated throughout the sectors , by public information staff , military observers , non-governmental organizations and other cooperating partners . In addition , it produces and widely disseminates 5,000 copies of a monthly magazine in French to increase the public's understanding of the Mission's mandate and of new developments in the peace process . This component also issues a daily press review , which covers international media and press clippings , a weekly newsletter and a bi-weekly bulletin . At the same time the photography unit of the Mission has created an archiving system and makes regular contributions to MONUC publications , media requests , and the MONUC web site , www . monuc . org . The video unit has been reinforced and has produced an informational video on the Mission . It also produced a video on the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration operation in Beni and disseminated it to the sectors . Full video coverage of the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration operation in Kamina-Kigali was also produced and presented to the ex-combatants in the Kamina camp on 10 October before dissemination to all sectors , as part of the information campaign on that process . MONUC is also disseminating information to areas where armed groups are located . Radio Okapi and MONUC publications are increasingly being used to encourage combatants to disarm and repatriate . Three portable mobile radio facilities with FM transmission , to be used for this purpose , were recently procured and should be installed soon . There were several incidents in which local authorities harassed and intimidated Radio Okapi journalists . On 27 August , in Kindu , RCD-Goma military officers arrested and physically assaulted a Radio Okapi journalist . On 13 September , in Gbadolite , another Radio Okapi journalist was detained for eight days by MLC authorities for reporting on the condition of child combatants in the MLC forces . Human rights MONUC continues to receive regular information indicating that the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains precarious . In recent months , in areas controlled by the Government , there have been several cases of prolonged detention of human rights defenders , a wave of arrests of journalists and the heavy sentencing of some for imputations dommageables , the arrest and detention of relatives and supporters of the leaders of an opposition political party , the Union pour la démocratie et le progrès social ( UDPS ) , and cases of prolonged detention without trial on the order of the Military Prosecutor General . Information received by MONUC includes allegations of arbitrary killings and rapes and excessive use of force by the security forces of all the parties . The situation is particularly worrying in the east . MONUC is especially concerned about consistent reports of violence against women by security and armed groups . On 20 June , the international non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch issued a report documenting the systematic use of rape and other forms of sexual violence against women and girls by armed groups operating in the east . The victims do not always report these incidents , primarily for fear of rejection by their communities and of reprisals . Consequently , there is no appropriate treatment immediately available to these women and girls . MONUC is following up on this report with a view to increasing the protection of women and girls against rape and other violations of human rights . Widespread and grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law continue to be perpetrated by the armed opposition following several armed conflicts between RCD-Goma / RPA on the one hand , and the Mayi-Mayi and uncontrolled , foreign armed groups on the other , especially in South Kivu and Maniema Provinces . MONUC continues to gather information and report on the conditions of detainees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , where another aspect of the human rights situation is the deplorable state of prisons and other detention centres . Throughout the country , people continue to be detained without due process . Detainees are treated in a degrading and inhumane manner . Detainees who are beneficiaries of presidential amnesties remain imprisoned . The past three months in Kindu have been marked by human rights violations that have far surpassed the predicted worst-case scenarios . The crisis erupted in August , shortly after RCD reinforced its eighth Brigade with a new commander and chief of staff , both of whom were allegedly involved in the massacres of 14 May in Kisangani . In retaliation for a failed offensive against the Mayi-Mayi , the RCD-Goma soldiers summarily executed 46 civilians , including a 15-year-old boy , and seven members of the same family . In Kindu itself the President of RCD-Goma , in a radio broadcast , accused MONUC of complicity with the Mayi-Mayi . This speech was followed by an outbreak of violence against suspected Mayi-Mayi sympathizers , which reportedly resulted in the killing of 25 people . Most recent reports involve the public execution , on 22 September , of three RCD-Goma soldiers who robbed a trader and , on 6 October , the summary execution by RCD-Goma of six fishermen suspected of being Mayi-Mayi . The number and scale of gross human rights violations is growing rapidly and the situation demands greater protection of civilians under imminent threat of physical violence . Report of the Commission on Human Rights on Kisangani At the request of the Security Council , the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in cooperation with MONUC undertook an investigation of the events of mid-May in Kisangani , covered in the eleventh report on MONUC ( S / 2002 / 621 ) . From 16 to 22 June , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions of the Commission on Human Rights , Asma Jahangir , conducted a fact-finding mission to Kinshasa , Goma and Kisangani . On 16 July , the then High Commissioner for Human Rights , Mary Robinson , submitted a report on the Special Rapporteur's findings and recommendations on the Kisangani situation to the Security Council . The Security Council condemned the actions of RCD-Goma in Kisangani and demanded that the rebel movement bring the perpetrators of the killings to justice . Child protection The reporting period was marked by a disturbing upsurge in the recruitment of child soldiers . MONUC verified the existence of a training camp run by RPA in the area of Luvungui north of Uvira . Of the estimated 500 Mayi-Mayi in training at that location , between 50 and 100 were children under the age of 18 . The majority of the victims in the ongoing Hema-Lendu conflict in the area of Bunia are women and children . Among the hundreds of injured women and children admitted to hospitals in Bunia , 80 per cent suffer from wounds to the head , hands and extremities . The perpetrators used knives , cudgels , machetes and other sharp implements as their weapons . The fighting between UPC and RCD-K / ML forces in the north-east has led to a significant rise in the number of child soldiers being recruited by the forces in that area . In Bunia , the forces of Commander Thomas Lubanga have recruited large numbers of child soldiers . Although UNICEF , MONUC and non-governmental organizations continue to plan for and advocate child demobilization in rebel-held areas , rebel parties have not yet agreed to give the international community access to military sites . Discussions on the establishment of child demobilization subcommissions have not yet borne fruit . It is hoped that the latest UNICEF / RCD-Goma efforts will result in the establishment of a subcommission in Kisangani in the near future . Plans for the demobilization of child soldiers in the context of overall disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration are well under way . This is being done in conjunction with other relevant partners , most notably UNICEF . With the Government of Norway's financial contribution to support the peace process , the Child Protection Section has finalized a plan to augment the capacity of local non-governmental organizations to receive and aid possible child ex-combatants completing the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration exercise in the Beni-Butembo area . Child protection advisers work together with UNICEF , which is providing similar emergency expansion capacity to local child protection non-governmental organizations in Bukavu in anticipation of needs related to disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration in the area . Gender issues Raising the gender awareness of MONUC personnel , agency partners and the population has been the focus of the work of the gender section . The medium - to long-term objective is to ensure the integration of a gender perspective into all aspects of the Mission's work . On 23 July , the gender section convened a strategic planning meeting with the Mission's military and civilian staff to create an action plan for integrating the concept of gender into all MONUC activities . The next step will be to form Mission-wide gender working groups to assess the gender dimensions of the Mission's work and ensure that gender concerns are accounted for in all of its activities . Sessions on gender sensitivity also continue to be a regular part of the induction programmes offered to all incoming military , civilian and civilian police staff . This is in addition to the gender awareness training of trainers for the local police in Kisangani . Meetings with Congolese civil society organizations , media , and church organizations across the country to discuss their views on the peace process are still being held . The major outcome of such work is to harmonize the vision of women's groups from the east and the west so that they can work out strategies to ensure their full participation in the implementation of the Nairobi Declaration adopted prior to the inter-Congolese dialogue . A plan of action to address the reports of violence against women in the east was also discussed by various stakeholders . Humanitarian activities Humanitarian conditions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remain deeply disturbing . Civilians continue to bear the brunt of the crisis . Approximately 17 million people – almost a third of the country's population of approximately 53 million – are in need of urgent food aid , while approximately 2.2 million people are displaced within the country . During the reporting period , significant new displacement was reported in Ituri and Maniema Provinces . Women , children and the elderly are the most affected by the conflict . A humanitarian assessment team comprising the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator and representatives of MONUC travelled to Minembwe-Itombwe on 2 August , under the protection of RPA . The team was , however , denied access to other areas further west in the Hauts Plateaux , where there had been fighting between RCD-Goma / RPA and Commander Masunzu's forces 48 hours before the mission . On 3 August , the team travelled to Fizi-Baraka , but a hostile crowd of civilians and soldiers prevented them from leaving the airport . The mission was successfully completed on 8 August , however . The Humanitarian Coordinator described the situation in the border region of Uvira , the Hauts Plateaux and Fizi-Baraka as a "" creeping disaster "" , with over 100 villages deserted and 20,000 newly displaced families , bringing the total number of internally displaced people in South Kivu to an estimated 400,000 . In the context of continuous military offensives against Masunzu's stronghold , humanitarian assistance in the area remains limited to ad hoc interventions conducted by the International Committee of the Red Cross . Humanitarian affairs officers have witnessed an increase in recent months in the harassment of relief workers and the looting of their assets . Humanitarian staff in Bunia and Dungu experienced threats of physical violence and looting , which in Bunia resulted in the loss of nearly 14 tons of food destined for vulnerable populations . Several humanitarian teams were evacuated , most notably from Shabunda and Nyankunde . In many areas where there is widespread insecurity , health conditions are reported to have deteriorated alarmingly , and there is evidence of very high malnutrition rates among the populations . Access to war-affected areas remains critical for humanitarian partners . The deteriorating humanitarian situation against the backdrop of planned disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration activities requires a reinvigorated humanitarian effort that expands coverage to more locations . Following consultations with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and other United Nations and non-governmental partners , MONUC will shortly extend its humanitarian presence beyond its current locations in Kinshasa , Mbandaka , Bukavu , Kisangani , Gbadolite , Kalemie and Goma to under-served locations with significant humanitarian needs . MONUC logistical capabilities have been a great asset to the humanitarian community's relief efforts in the country . From June to September , MONUC transported more than 95 tons of humanitarian cargo . MONUC also supported the 2002 National Polio Vaccination Campaign during those months ; the campaign achieved 85 to 90 per cent coverage . Mine action While less of a hazard than in other mission areas , mines and unexploded ordnance are still present in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Most mines were planted in 1999 and 2000 . In particular , the areas of Kisangani and Ikela are heavily mined . Reportedly , FAC , RCD , UPDF and RPA frequently used mines in the Mbuji-Mayi , Kabinda , Kabalo , Pweto , Beni , Buta and Tshopo areas . As a consequence of the conflict in Burundi , landmines were planted in Kivu in the Uvira region , close to the Burundi border . It is believed that Uvira , Baraka , Makobolo and the Ruzizi Valley are mined . Reportedly , UPC has also used mines in the recent fighting around Bunia . MONUC works in close collaboration with the Mine Action Coordination Centre , with offices in Kinshasa and Kisangani . MONUC and the Centre share a database on mines and unexploded ordnance and have well-defined standard operational procedures . Mine-clearing activities conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are limited to the work of a Belgian non-governmental organization which works closely with the Mine Action Coordination Centre , local partners and MONUC military engineers . Demining activities in support of MONUC operations in Kindu are currently under contract negotiation , while the contract in Kisangani has been finalized . Quick-impact projects In enhancing its effectiveness , MONUC is endeavouring to engage actively with the local population as a means of winning the support necessary to carry out its mandate . The Mission has made extensive use of quick-impact projects , with a view to making a demonstrable , positive difference in the lives of the people where MONUC is deployed and to enhance its credibility with the local population . MONUC has focused on high visibility projects in the areas of restoration or enhancement of water services and water purification ; provision of public sanitation ; provision of basic medical equipment and medical supplies ; repairs to school buildings and provision of basic school furniture / materiel ; repairs to hospitals / medical facilities ; and repairs to basic community infrastructure . The Mission's phase III activities , outlined in the special report , will imply deployment into new areas in the east , most of which have suffered from years of conflict . It will be essential for the success of the phase III activities to continue reaching out to the local population to ensure their acceptance of the Mission , and therefore to extend funding for quick-impact projects during phase III . Review and assessment mission The Department of Peacekeeping Operations sent a review and assessment mission to MONUC from 28 July to 8 August , led by former Assistant Secretary-General Manfred Eisele . The aim of the mission was to review the present capability of MONUC to implement its mandate and to meet future challenges , especially in the face of major changes in the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The review team , which travelled all over the Mission area , examined various aspects of the MONUC operations and also met with members of the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda as well as the diplomatic community in Kinshasa and Kigali . The review mission found MONUC staff members to be active and committed to fulfilling the Mission's mandate . They were extremely frank with the review mission in expressing their views on how MONUC could improve its activities as it geared up for phase III activities . The mission found that the main areas in need of enhancement include the setting of overall strategic direction and communication of such direction throughout the Mission and beyond ; strengthening management of the Mission through the appointment of a second deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for operations and management , strengthening a number of key posts and ensuring that the Mission is properly staffed ; reviewing the delegation of authority and ensuring appropriate command and control arrangements throughout the Mission ; enhancing information flows and policy and analysis functions , as well as coordination of activities throughout all components of the Mission ; and ensuring that the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration programme is "" mainstreamed "" through the Mission and is provided with the full support of all components . The report of the assessment mission was presented to me on 1 October , and the members of the Security Council and troop-contributing countries were briefed on the main elements . Subsequent to my approval of the review mission's wide-ranging recommendations , the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has initiated an action plan so that MONUC can more effectively implement its mandate . In due course , the Department will conduct a review of the implementation of these important recommendations . Logistical activities As MONUC continues its eastward deployment and intensifies the preparations for the launching of a full-scale disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration operation , the daunting logistical support tasks that lie ahead become ever more apparent . Arrangements for the deployment of the two task forces and setting up of temporary reception centres would involve a carefully planned and coordinated engineering effort , requiring an integrated civilian and military approach to optimize the use of the limited engineering resources available in MONUC . Since many of the reception centres may be located in remote and scattered locations with poor or no road access , additional air assets will be required to deploy personnel and equipment to establish , operate and dismantle the centres and associated accommodation camps for ex-combatants and possibly their dependants . Consideration will also have to be given to modalities and funding arrangements for the transportation of the combatants and their families ( estimated at around 90,000 persons ) from the reception centres to their final destinations . Additional technical expertise for the upkeep of airfields associated with centres and camps and to support air operations in general will also need to be considered . The capacities of the logistic bases in Kinshasa and Kisangani will be increased and a new logistic base at Kigoma , United Republic of Tanzania , is being considered to optimize the delivery of equipment and stores . Since logistics operations involving the mobile disarmament and demobilization sites will be complex , the two task forces will have to be self-sustained , and it is expected that all major contingent-owned equipment will be provided under "" wet lease "" arrangements . The task forces will also need to have sufficient integral engineering and aviation assets to support MONUC operations in the specific areas of the establishment of disarmament , demobilization and reintegration reception centres and associated camps , water purification , maintenance of runways / landing grounds and local access road networks , airfield support services and operational demining tasks . Financial aspects The General Assembly , by its resolution 56 / 252 C of 27 June 2002 , appropriated an amount of $ 581 . 9 million for MONUC for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 . Since its establishment in October 1999 , the Trust Fund to support the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has received voluntary contributions amounting to $ 1 . 1 million , with expenditures authorized to date in the full amount . As at 31 August 2002 , unpaid assessed contributions to the MONUC special account amounted to $ 322 . 9 million . The total outstanding assessed contributions for all peacekeeping operations at that date amounted to $ 1 , 781 . 1 million . Observations Since my last progress report to the Security Council , there have been significant developments in the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The signing of the Pretoria and Luanda agreements , the consequent withdrawals of foreign forces from the country , the arrest of three persons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Luanda , Brazzaville and Kinshasa , the banning of the FDLR leadership based in Kinshasa , the successful exploratory visit to Rwanda of a group of ex-combatants and their dependants from Kamina , and the increased contacts between the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda and Uganda are all major steps which can have lasting , positive implications for the political and military situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The parties should be congratulated for the political will they have demonstrated in moving the peace process forward . Nevertheless , there continue to be serious challenges . Heavy fighting continues in the north-eastern and eastern parts of the country . The fragile peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and recent gains made in the implementation of the Pretoria Agreement are in serious danger of being reversed because of the most recent military offensive undertaken against Uvira and other key locations in the east . I urge all parties to put an end to all hostilities and take advantage of the positive atmosphere and opportunities created by recent developments in the country , and especially welcome the role of the Government of South Africa in its persistent effort to keep the peace process on track . The situation in the Ituri region remains worrying . My previous progress reports described the continuing violence and abuses in that area , which have worsened recently . All parties concerned should now work together to promote confidence . I commend the establishment in the Ituri region of the Joint Pacification Commission , under the terms of the Luanda Agreement , and hope that it will serve to restore peace and stability in this troubled region of the country . Equally , the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a source of grave concern . The current culture of impunity that exists in many parts of the country must end , and those responsible for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law must be held accountable . The recent arrests of individuals indicted by the Tribunal and their transfer to Arusha is encouraging in this regard . I strongly condemn the threats and harassment against MONUC staff , including those working for Radio Okapi . The instigators of the latest incidents in Kisangani and elsewhere in the Democratic Republic of the Congo bear responsibility for such acts and must understand that , in order for peace and normalcy to return to the country , the safety and security of United Nations personnel must be guaranteed . There must also be a free flow of information ; the role of Radio Okapi is fundamental in this process . As the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo moves forward , the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , resettlement and reintegration of foreign armed groups will become a central part of MONUC operations . The Mission has been active in promoting the early implementation of this crucial programme . I am gratified by the close collaboration between MONUC and the different international partners , including the United Nations agencies and programmes , the World Bank , and other members of the donor community ; the United Nations is determined to strengthen this vital coordination . The progress achieved so far in the inter-Congolese dialogue is encouraging . The increasing willingness of the various political actors to engage and address their counterparts is a welcome sign . In this regard , I urge all parties to be guided by the interests of the Congolese people . I believe it is essential to look beyond the distribution of posts in the transitional administration leading towards a new political dispensation , and to begin addressing issues such as security sector reform and the extension of State authority throughout the country . Above all , the Congolese leadership must focus on the creation of a reformed and revitalized State that can meet the aspirations of its people . We must not allow the present opportunity to be lost . I also call on all parties to cooperate in the mediation efforts of my Special Envoy , Moustapha Niasse , and the Government of South Africa , with a view to reaching an early understanding on the transitional arrangements foreseen under the Lusaka Agreement . The United Nations will continue to do its utmost and work with the Congolese parties and people to achieve these aims . To do so , the full support of the international community is needed . In my special report , I have already referred to the need to give strong impetus to the peace process . I once again encourage the Security Council to take the necessary decisions in this regard . Finally , I wish to express my appreciation to my Special Representative , Amos Namanga Ngongi , to the Force Commander , Major General Mountaga Diallo , and to all the men and women of MONUC , military and civilian , for their untiring efforts under the very challenging circumstances still prevailing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .

1028,1564,A1,"State lawmakers may try to place a moratorium on using predictions of accelerated sea-level rise in coastal planning while the state studies the issue in the coming years . Rep. Pat McElraft , R-Carteret , on Tuesday discussed a plan to address the contentious sea-level-rise issue this year and beyond . The House , she said , could take up the sea-level-rise bill this week and vote not to accept the measure as it recently passed the Senate . If the House votes not to concur with the Senate version , it would put the issue in front of a conference committee of House and Senate members . There , McElraft said , the plan is to place a moratorium on using accelerated rates of sea-level rise in writing coastal development policies while the state studies the issue . McElraft said a study , which would be conducted at least in part by the Coastal Resources Commission , should look at all of the available science on the issue , "" not just one model like the Science Panel looked at . "" "" We need to look at this more scientifically and not with a political agenda , "" McElraft said . As it passed the Senate , the bill would prohibit state agencies from using projections of accelerated sea-level rise – mainly from global warming and the melting of polar ice caps – in drafting coastal development rules . Instead they would have to use only historical sea-level-rise data . The historic rates of rise are much lower than many scientists believe the seas will rise in the future . But that report has been criticized by some along the coast who say planning for such a dramatic rise in sea levels could have a significant economic impact on eastern North Carolina because homes and roads and other infrastructure would have to be built farther from the ocean or higher off the ground . They also say enacting policies based on 1 meter of rise could lead to higher insurance rates and restrictions on land use along the coast . Sen. David Rouzer , R-Johnston , who ushered the measure through the Senate , said Tuesday afternoon that he may not support McElraft's idea . Thank Heaven for Global Warming .. With Large chunks of the Antarctic ice sheet breaking off and melting into the Ocean we should be able to expect LOWER Sea Levels ... For some odd reason Water expands when frozen taking up more volume ... These people are just silly and their ideas ridiculous . Just another waste of money an time . When it comes to climate change , the notion that there are opposing scientific viewpoints is laughable at best . While there are a few holdouts ( mostly those paid by the oil and gas industry ) who may have their doubts as to its causes , a vast majority of the scientific community agree – the earth is getting warmer and the polar ice caps are slowly melting – mainly due to the continued emission of carbon gases into our atmosphere . People who ignore the SCIENCE of climate change are all talk . That is until they need the rest of us to come and bail them out with beach renourishment funding , subsidized insurance rates , and emergency management funds . Any person foolish enough to build on a NC barrier island deserves to pay for their foolishness themselves . This plan to stick your head in the sand and then expect the rest of us to bail you out is n't working for the majority of NC citizens and taxpayers . </doc>

612,1159,A1,"Games and Violence Computer games have seriously caught the attention of Mass Media and nowadays every channel considers its duty to remind people how much damage these games cause to children and adults . The increasing amount of games with violent scenes sock the society and makes it very aware of them . It is already common knowledge that violent games cause violence in people . This fact is not even doubted by the majority of people . Every other person says that the reason lies in games being too close to reality . The opinion that games make violent actions normal for the player and therefore make the player pitiless can be often heard . In this case the game is the cause of violence and the act of violence by itself is a consequence . And can real-life violence exist in the reality of a game ? Is the transfer of the definition of "" violence "" with all its peculiarities from one world to another justified only according to the external similarity of these two worlds ? Games originally are entertainment . Contemporary games are very realistic and for this reason they are a source of great experience for the player and develop the imagination . Games are entertainment and even more then that . In addition , the statistics of the New York University lead by Green and Bavelier claim that the player preferring active games get an improvement of some types of brain activity , related to processing of visual information . In particular , game players cope with problems of simultaneously tracking several moving objects at the average level of 30 % better then people who do not play active computer video games . The "" gaming "" violent experience may not be the cause of violent behavior in reality . None of the playing experience will become the priority in making important decisions concerning problems in real life . A game is an abstraction . A player gets abstract tasks and acts according to abstract rules . Games are also the possibility to be however a person wants to be and to rest from the outside world for some time . But what if a person gets so much excited with the game scenes that he becomes violent in reality ? Then , it proves that the games cause people to become violent . Let us stop for a moment right at this point . Those who do not participate in this type of activity usually make the conclusion of presence of violence in the game-world . Nobody will ever hear this kind of statement from those who play , from those who know the rules of the game and understand that it is just a virtual world . A psychologically healthy person will never confuse or connect these two different worlds . A game is a virtual world with visual images very similar to human . These images represent by themselves nothing but simple playing obstacles . A game may potentially give the opportunity to "" destroy the obstacles "" that may not be destroyed according to the rules but it is more about personal choice whether to do it or not . This leads us to the conclusion that violence is not a consequence but the cause . People who are originally prone to violence may get irritated by games and perform violence in the "" real world "" . But in this case violence in games is a simple justification of the violent nature of the player . </doc>

960,1133,A17,"' Inferno ' Review : Tom Hanks ' Return as ' Da Vinci Code ' Hero Goes Up in Flames Third adaptation of Dan Brown's bestselling religio-pulp series feels like a trip to hell and back – and not in a good way ' Inferno , ' the third movie of Dan Brown's bestselling religio-pulp novels starring Tom Hanks , feels like a trip to hell and back , says Peter Travers . ' Inferno ' Review : Tom Hanks ' Return as ' Da Vinci Code ' Hero Goes Up in Flames More News Here 's the third futile attempt by director Ron Howard to turn the bestselling claptrap of author Dan Brown into something watchable . He comes close , but not close enough . This time Robert Langdon , the Harvard symbologist played as if against his will by Tom Hanks , suffers from retrograde amnesia . Lucky guy – I can remember all too well how the film's plodding predecessors , The Da Vinci Code ( 2006 ) and Angels & Demons ( 2009 ) , stubbornly refused to come to life . Howard , shooting in Florence and Istanbul , makes things look compellingly atmospheric . And Hanks is one of the most likable actors on the planet . But Inferno just lays there onscreen , pancake-flat and with no animating spark to make us give a damn . Related From awards-worthy dramas and controversial history lessons to a new ' Star Wars , ' what you need to see Which is strange , since the fate of the world hangs in the balance in David Koepp's surprise-free script . Extremist billionaire Bertrand Zobrist ( Ben Foster , a master at crazed stares ) has decided there are too many people in the world . He 's fired up to unleash a plague-like virus that will narrow the herd to a manageable few . Langdon ca n't let that happen : Who would buy Dan Brown novels with no herds around ? Dazed and confused , our hero wakes up in a Florence hospital , under the care of Dr. Sienna Brooks ( Felicity Jones ) , wondering why he 's even in Italy and why he has Jason Bourne disease . Something about a gunshot wound , head trauma , and clues that can be found in Botticelli's 15th-century painting The Abyss of Hell and Dante's Divine Comedy . Bad guys and one nasty woman , a carabinieri named Vayentha ( Ana Ularu ) , start chasing Langdon and the good doc . No romance here , for better or worse , though Langdon makes eyes with the age-appropriate World Health Organization director Elizabeth Sinskey ( the most excellent Sidse Babett Knudsen of Westworld ) . They have a history , you see . And while your mind wanders trying to make sense of this gibberish , the great Irrfan Khan shows up as the Provost , the head of a consulting group that 's up to no good . Happily , Khan chews into his villainous role like a ripe peach and gives Inferno a jolt of momentum that vanishes when he does . What remains is a stilted travelogue with fancy art references . In one early scene , a character takes a swan dive off a picturesque belltower . The fall , like everything else in this series of pretty pictures posing as cinema , is shot magnificently by Salvatore Totino . Still , there 's something wrong with a movie that makes you envy a squashed corpse . Do n't Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox .

725,1669,A16,"voter model coexists on the graph with two clusters One can imagine that there is a "" voter "" at each point on a connected graph , where the connections indicate that there is some form of interaction between a pair of voters ( nodes ) . The opinions of any given voter on some issue changes at random times under the influence of opinions of his neighbours . A voter's opinion at any given time can take one of two values , labelled 0 and 1 . At random times , a random individual is selected and that voter's opinion are changed according to a stochastic rule . Specifically , for one of the chosen voter's neighbors is chosen according to a given set of probabilities and that individual's opinion is transferred to the chosen voter . An alternative interpretation is in terms of spatial conflict . Suppose two nations control the areas ( sets of nodes ) labelled 0 or 1 . A flip from 0 to 1 at a given location indicates an invasion of that site by the other nation . Note that only one flip happens each time . Problems involving the voter model will often be recast in terms of the dual system of coalescing Markov chains . Frequently , these problems will then be reduced to others involving independent Markov chains . What we are interested in is the limiting behavior of the models . Since the flip rates of a site depends its neighbours , it is obvious that when all sites take the same value , the whole system stops changing forever . Therefore , a voter model has two trivial extremal stationary distributions , the point-masses δ 0 and δ 1 on η ≡ 0 or η ≡ 1 respectively , which represent consensus . The main question we will discuss is whether or not there are others , which would then represent coexistence of different opinions in equilibrium . We say that coexistence occurs if there is a stationary distribution that concentrates on configurations with infinitely many 0 's and 1 's . </doc>

683,1247,A8,""" Over the past several years , as we 've worked toward the goals outlined in UB 2020 , UB has hired many outstanding junior researchers , "" says Alexander N. Cartwright , vice president for research and economic development . "" The recognition that so many of these new faculty members are receiving CAREER awards from the National Science Foundation is evidence of the value they are bringing to our university and the Buffalo Niagara community , "" he adds . "" The CAREER award is given to some of the nation's most promising early-career investigators , and gives them resources to grow their research programs . "" The four new CAREER recipients at UB , each of whom received the award in 2013 , include an engineer studying how to improve drug-delivery methods and a chemist whose work could lead to new ways of disrupting harmful biochemical reactions . Their CAREER grants range in size from $ 400 , 000 to $ 550 , 000 . UB's new CAREER awardees , the amounts of their awards and their research topics are : The advancement relies on sensors that use ultrasound – the same inaudible sound waves used by the navy for sonar and doctors for sonograms – to wirelessly share information between medical devices implanted in or worn by people . Because roughly 65 percent of the body is composed of water , ultrasound may be a more efficient way to share information than the current practice of using radio waves . Medical devices , such as a pacemaker and an instrument that measures blood oxygen levels , may communicate more effectively via ultrasound than radio waves . In all living things , specialized proteins called enzymes speed up chemical reactions critical to life . At a point in each reaction called the transition state , the materials undergoing transformation become extremely unstable , and enzymes jump in to provide stability and allow the reaction to reach its conclusion at acceptable rates . Murkin will use his CAREER award to develop new techniques for studying the transition state . Knowing more about its characteristics will allow scientists to stop harmful reactions , such as those linked to cancer or infectious diseases , by designing molecules that mimic the transition state . These mimics trick the enzyme into latching onto them instead of helping the undesired reaction proceed . By disrupting important chemical reactions , transition state inhibitors could kill disease-causing bacteria . David Salac , assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering , $ 401 , 192 , Electrohydrodynamics of vesicles . Vesicles are small , fluid-filled structures that mimic simple biological cells , such as red blood cells . Salac is using his CAREER award to study how single - and multi-component vesicles react to the combined effects of fluid flow and electric fields . Electric fields have been shown to change not only the shape of vesicles , but also the permeability of the vesicle membrane . This knowledge will advance the development of vesicle-based biotechnologies , such as directed drug delivery and pico-scale bioreactors . This research also will provide knowledge about the mechanics of red blood cells and other non-nucleated biological cells . Complex networks are everywhere . Examples include biological networks , such as the nervous system ; infrastructure , such as power grids ; and communication networks like the Internet . The common theme is that individual pieces , or nodes , interact with each other to form a network capable of complex tasks . Scutari will use his CAREER award to develop a unified framework for the analysis and design of complex networks with no centralized control . Examples of this kind of behavior are schools of fish or flocks of birds . The research could help improve everything from power grids to cell phone networks . </doc>

406,919,A4,"Three Boys ; or the Chiefs of the Clan Mackhai George Manville Fenn | Next chapter | | Contents | Chapter I. The Mackhai of Dun Roe . "" Look here , Scoodrach , if you call me she again , I 'll kick you ! "" "" I didna ca ' you she . I only said if she 'd come ten the hoose aifter she had the parritch -- "" "" Well , what did I say ? "" "" Say ? Why , she got in a passion . "" Whop ! Flop ! The sound of a back-handed slap in the chest , followed by a kick , both delivered by Kenneth Mackhai , the recipient being a red-headed , freckled-faced lad of seventeen , who retaliated by making a sharp snatch at the kicking foot , which he caught and held one half moment . The result was startling . Kenneth Mackhai , the sun-browned , well-knit , handsome son of "" the Chief , "" came down in a sitting position on the stones , and screwed up his face with pain . "" Scood , you beggar ! "" he roared ; "" I 'll serve you out for -- "" "" Ken , are you coming to breakfast ? "" cried a loud , severe voice from fifty yards away . "" Coming , father ! "" shouted the lad , leaping up , giving himself a shake to rearrange his dark green kilt , and holding up his fist threateningly at the bare-legged , grinning lad before him . "" Just you wait till after breakfast , Master Scood , and I 'll make you squint . "" The lad ran up the steep slope to the garden surrounding the ancient castle of Dunroe , which had been built as a stronghold somewhere about the fourteenth century , and still stood solid on its rocky foundation ; a square , keep-like edifice , with a round tower at each corner , mouldering , with portions of the battlements broken away , but a fine monument still of the way in which builders worked in the olden time . The portion Kenneth Mackhai approached had for inhabitants only the jackdaws , which encumbered the broken stairs by the loopholes with their nests ; but , after passing beneath a gloomy archway and crossing the open interior , he left the old keep by another archway , to enter the precincts of the modern castle of Dunroe , a commodious building , erected after the style of the old , and possessing the advantages of a roof and floors , with large windows looking across the dazzling sea . Kenneth entered a handsome dining-room , where the breakfast was spread , and where his father , The Mackhai , a tall , handsome man of fifty , was pacing angrily up and down . "" Sorry I kept you , father . Scood said there was a seal on the lower rocks , and -- "" "" The scoundrel ! How dare he ? "" muttered The Mackhai . "" To take such a mean advantage of his position . I will not suffer it . I 'll -- "" "" I 'm very sorry , father ! "" faltered Kenneth , crossing slowly toward his frowning elder . "" I did not mean to -- "" "" Eh ! what , Ken , my boy ? "" cried The Mackhai , with his countenance changing . "" I 've only just come in . Sit down , my lad . You must be half-starved , eh ? "" "" I thought you were cross with me , sir . "" "" Cross ? Angry ? Not a bit . Why ? "" "" You said -- "" "" Tchah ! nonsense ! Thinking aloud . What did you say ? -- a seal ? "" "" Yes , father . Scood said there was one , but it had gone . "" "" Then you did n't shoot it ? Well , I 'm not sorry . They 're getting scarce now , and I like to see the old things about the old place . Hah ! "" he continued , after a pause that had been well employed by both at the amply-supplied , handsomely-furnished table ; "" and I like the old porridge for breakfast . Give me some of that salmon , Ken. No ; I 'll have a kipper . "" "" More coffee , please , father , "" said Ken , with his mouth full . "" Have a scone , father ? They 're prime . "" "" Gently with the butter , my boy . There is such a thing as bile . "" "" Is there , father ? "" said Kenneth , who was spreading the rich yellow churning a full quarter of an inch thick . "" Is there , sir ! Yes , there is . As I know to my cost . Ah ! "" he added , with a sigh , and his face wrinkled and made him look ten years older ; "" but there was a time when I did not know the meaning of the word ! "" "" Oh , I say , father , "" cried Kenneth merrily , "" do n't ! You 're always pretending to be old , and yet you can walk me down stalking , and Long Shon says you can make him sore-footed any day . "" "" Nonsense ! nonsense ! "" said The Mackhai , smiling . "" Oh , but you can , father ! "" said Kenneth , with his mouth full . "" And see how you ran with that salmon yesterday , all among the stones . "" "" Ah , yes ! I manage to hold my own ; but I hope you 'll husband your strength better than I did , my boy , "" said The Mackhai , with a sigh . "" I only hope I shall grow into such a fine man ! "" cried Kenneth , with his face lighting up , as he gazed proudly at his father . "" Why , Donald says -- "" "" Tut , tut , tut ! Silence , you miserable young flatterer ! Do you want to make your father conceited ? There , that will do . "" "" Coming fishing to-day , father ? "" There was no answer . The Mackhai had taken up a letter brought in that morning by one of the gillies , and was frowning over it as he re-read its contents , and then sat thoughtfully gazing out of the window across the glittering sea , at the blue mountains in the distance , tapping the table with his fingers the while . "" Wonder what 's the matter ! "" thought Kenneth . "" Some one wants some money , I suppose . "" The boy's face puckered up a little as he ceased eating , and watched his father's face , the furrows in the boy's brow giving him a wonderful likeness to the keen-eyed , high-browed representative of a fine old Scottish clan . "" Wish I had plenty of money , "" thought Kenneth ; and he sighed as he saw his father's face darken . Not that there was the faintest sign of poverty around , for the room was tastily furnished in good old style ; the carpet was thick , a silver coffee-pot glistened upon the table , and around the walls were goodly paintings of ancestral Mackhais , from the bare-armed , scale-armoured chief who fought the Macdougals of Lome , down to Ronald Mackhai , who represented Ross-shire when King William sat upon the throne . "" I ca n't help myself , "" muttered The Mackhai at last . "" Here , Ken , what were you going to do to-day ? "" "" I was going up the river after a salmon . "" "" Not to-day , my boy . Here , I 've news for you . Mr. Blande , my London solicitor , writes me word that his son is coming down--a boy about your age . "" "" Son--coming down ? Did you invite him , father ? "" "" Eh ? No : never mind that , "" said The Mackhai hastily . "" Coming down to stay with us a bit . Regular London boy . Not in very good health . You must be civil to him , Ken , and show him about a bit . "" "" Yes , father , "" said Kenneth , who felt from his father's manner that the coming guest was not welcome . "" He is coming by Glasgow , and then by the Grenadier . His father thinks the sea will do him good . Go and meet him . "" "" Yes , father . "" "" Tell them to get a room ready for him . "" "" Yes , father . "" "" Be as civil to him as you can , and--Pah ! "" That ejaculation , pah ! came like an angry outburst , as The Mackhai gave the table a sharp blow , and rose and strode out of the room . Kenneth sat watching the door for a few moments . "" Father's savage because he 's coming , "" said Kenneth , whose eyes then fell upon a glass dish of marmalade , and , cutting a goodly slice of bread , he spread it with the yellow butter , and then spooned out a portion of the amber-hued preserve . "" Bother the chap ! we do n't want him here . "" Pe-au , pe-au , came a wailing whistle through the open window . "" Ah , I hear you , old whaupie , but I can do it better than that , "" said Kenneth to himself , as he repeated the whistle , in perfect imitation of the curlews which abounded near . The whistle was answered , and , with a good-tempered smile on his face , Kenneth rose from the table , after cutting another slice of bread , and laying it upon that in his plate , so as to form a sticky sandwich . "" Scood ! "" he cried from the window , and barelegged Scoodrach , who was seated upon a rock right below , with the waves splashing his feet , looked up and showed his white teeth . "" Catch ! "" "" All right . "" Down went the bread and marmalade , which the lad caught in his blue worsted bonnet , and was about to replace the same upon his curly red head , but the glutinous marmalade came off on one finger . This sticky finger he sucked as he stared at the bread , and , evidently coming to the conclusion that preserve and pomade were not synonymous terms , he began rapidly to put the sweet sandwich somewhere else . "" I wish you had kept it in your bonnet , Scood . "" The boy looked up and laughed , his mouth busy the while . "" Father saw sax saumon in the black pool , "" he cried eagerly . "" Then they 'll have to stop , "" said Kenneth gloomily . "" Eh ? "" "" There 's a chap coming down from London . "" "" To fesh ? "" "" Suppose so . We 've got to go and meet him . "" "" With ta pony ? "" "" No , the boat ; coming by the Grenadier . "" "" Ou ay . "" "" It 's a great bother , Scood . "" "" But it 's a verra fine mornin ' for a sail , "" said the boy , looking up and munching away . "" But I did n't want to sail ; I wanted to fish . "" "" The fush can wait , tat she can . "" "" Oh , you ! "" shouted Kenneth . "" Wish I had something to throw at you . "" "" If she did , I 'd throw it back , "" said Scoodrach , grinning . "" I should like to catch you at it . There , go and get the boat . "" "" Plenty of time . "" "" Never mind that ; let 's be off and have a good sail first , as we have to go . "" "" Will she--will you tak ' the gun ? "" "" Of course I shall . Take the lines too , Scood ; we may get a mackerel . "" The lad opened his large mouth , tucked in the last piece of marmalade , and then leaped off the stone on to the rock . "" Scood ! "" The boy stroked down his grey kilt , and looked up . "" Put on your shoes and stockings . "" "" What for ? "" "" Because I tell you . Because there 's company coming . Be off ! "" "" She 's got a big hole in her stocking , and ta shoe hurts her heel . "" "" Be off and put them on , "" roared Kenneth from the window . "" I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour . "" Scood nodded , and began to climb rapidly over the buttress of rock which ran down into the sea , the height to which the tide rose being marked by an encrustation of myriads of acorn barnacles , among which every now and then a limpet stood out like a boss , while below , in the clear water , a thick growth of weed turned the rock to a golden brown , and changed the tint of the transparent water . | Next chapter | | Contents | Created from a nineteenth or early twentieth century text by Athelstane E-Texts </doc>

502,913,A4,"It mattered not that they made him sea-sick--he made no account of this inconvenience ; and , whilst his body was writhing under their effects , his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation . Passepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weather . Everything had gone so well till now ! Earth and sea had seemed to be at his master's service ; steamers and railways obeyed him ; wind and steam united to speed his journey . Had the hour of adversity come ? Passepartout was as much excited as if the twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket . The storm exasperated him , the gale made him furious , and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience . Poor fellow ! Fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction , for , had he betrayed it , Passepartout could scarcely have restrained himself from personal violence . Passepartout remained on deck as long as the tempest lasted , being unable to remain quiet below , and taking it into his head to aid the progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew . He overwhelmed the captain , officers , and sailors , who could not help laughing at his impatience , with all sorts of questions . He wanted to know exactly how long the storm was going to last ; whereupon he was referred to the barometer , which seemed to have no intention of rising . Passepartout shook it , but with no perceptible effect ; for neither shaking nor maledictions could prevail upon it to change its mind . On the 4th , however , the sea became more calm , and the storm lessened its violence ; the wind veered southward , and was once more favourable . Passepartout cleared up with the weather . Some of the sails were unfurled , and the Rangoon resumed its most rapid speed . The time lost could not , however , be regained . Land was not signalled until five o ' clock on the morning of the 6th ; the steamer was due on the 5th . Phileas Fogg was twenty-four hours behind-hand , and the Yokohama steamer would , of course , be missed . The pilot went on board at six , and took his place on the bridge , to guide the Rangoon through the channels to the port of Hong Kong . Passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for Yokohama ; but he dared not , for he wished to preserve the spark of hope , which still remained till the last moment . He had confided his anxiety to Fix who--the sly rascal ! -- tried to console him by saying that Mr. Fogg would be in time if he took the next boat ; but this only put Passepartout in a passion . Mr. Fogg , bolder than his servant , did not hesitate to approach the pilot , and tranquilly ask him if he knew when a steamer would leave Hong Kong for Yokohama . "" At high tide to-morrow morning , "" answered the pilot . "" Ah ! "" said Mr. Fogg , without betraying any astonishment . Passepartout , who heard what passed , would willingly have embraced the pilot , while Fix would have been glad to twist his neck . "" What is the steamer's name ? "" asked Mr. Fogg . "" The Carnatic . "" "" Ought she not to have gone yesterday ? "" "" Yes , sir ; but they had to repair one of her boilers , and so her departure was postponed till to-morrow . "" "" Thank you , "" returned Mr. Fogg , descending mathematically to the saloon . Passepartout clasped the pilot's hand and shook it heartily in his delight , exclaiming , "" Pilot , you are the best of good fellows ! "" The pilot probably does not know to this day why his responses won him this enthusiastic greeting . He remounted the bridge , and guided the steamer through the flotilla of junks , tankas , and fishing boats which crowd the harbour of Hong Kong . At one o ' clock the Rangoon was at the quay , and the passengers were going ashore . Chance had strangely favoured Phileas Fogg , for had not the Carnatic been forced to lie over for repairing her boilers , she would have left on the 6th of November , and the passengers for Japan would have been obliged to await for a week the sailing of the next steamer . Mr. Fogg was , it is true , twenty-four hours behind his time ; but this could not seriously imperil the remainder of his tour . </doc>

1071,925,A4,"WEST BRITON , July 13 , 1838 John KINSMAN , 23 , was charged with having feloniously broken into the dwelling house of William TREVAN , and stolen therefrom 37 sovereigns , seven half-crowns , and three shillings . Mr. E. Coode having stated the case called William TREVAN , who said that he lived in Will Town , in the parish of St. Dominick ; he as a labouring man , and worked under the surveyor of roads . Had a wife , but no family , was in the habit of purchasing barley , potatoes , and other things for feeding pigs ; his wife had been a very independent woman , and had contrived to save some money . In the month of April , prosecutor had 37 sovereigns , seven half-crowns , and three shillings ; he kept it in a large red pocket-book , in a little box locked ; it was kept by his bed-side ; his house consisted of a bed-room , a room under the back house , a pig's house , and garden ; there was another house under the same roof , occupied by a neighbour ; there was a door leading from the kitchen to the back room , and another into the orchard ; saw the money last on the 29th of April ; his wife went to the box after that , and witness went on Sunday the 6th of May ; the pocket-book then contained the money ; remembered Wednesday , the 9th of May ; having passed through the back-door , witness barred it , and let the dropper fall , to prevent the bar being pushed back ; went to work at six o ' clock , and left his wife at home ; she was in the habit of going to work too ; Wednesday was Callington market day , and it was arranged that witness and his wife should meet there in the evening ; his wife was about nine years ago an inmate of the lunatic asylum ; she recovered from that illness and remained well until now ; witness left her at home ; she had been confined three weeks , and was not able to come and give evidence ; in consequence of what she told witness on Wednesday , he went home and examined the door of the back house ; there was a great hole broken in about half way up the door that leads from the orchard , and which he had barred in the morning . Witness found the box in the back-house ; the clothes were tumbled , and the box had been opened ; did not find his pocket-book or money there ; witness found two crooked sticks in the orchard , by which one of the doors could be opened after the hole was made . Knew the prisoner , he once occupied a room over the back house ; he was in the habit of coming to witness' house a great deal , and knew the premises very well ; he was there on the 5th of May , and witness did not see him between that day and the 9th . The prisoner was a miner . Cross-examined by Mr. John - Witness left his wife at home ; was quite sure that on the 6th of May , the prisoner did not rob the money , though it was on a Sunday night . Witness never showed the money to the prisoner , but his wife told the wife of the prisoner what money they had . Re-examined : Was at home when the prisoner called on the 6th of May , and they both left together ; the prisoner's wife left a waiter and umbrella for half-a-crown that prosecutor lent the prisoner to pay his rent ; his mother came shortly afterwards to redeem the umbrella and left the waiter ; the prisoner came on the 6th to know whether he might have the waiter and witness replied in the affirmative . The prisoner lived at Calstock . Thomas Peters lived at Metherill , between Calstock and Will Town ; recollected seeing the prisoner at Metherill on the day of the robbery between seven and eight o ' clock in the morning ; he went towards Callington where he said he was going . Cross-examined : Metherill was about two miles from Will Town . It was the high road where the prisoner was , and witness had seen him there many times before . Abraham BODDY lives at Metherill , and was at Callington on the day of the robbery ; on his return , he met the prisoner , between eight and nine in the morning , at a place called Cleave , and said he would be going from Will Town to Callington ; by going through a wood from Cleeve to Will Town , nearly half a mile would be saved , and the prisoner might have gone that way . The prisoner had his jacket off , and was walking at a pretty good pace . Cross-examined by Mr. Bennallack - Mertherill lies east from Will Town , and Cleave lies between both . Joseph COCKING examined : I live at Latchley , in the parish of Calstock ; am captain and manager of Gunnis Lake mine ; the last pay-day of April was the 28th ; that was also a setting day ; knows the prisoner ; he came there on the 28th , and took a pitch on the mine ; after the day was over , we had several who applied to have some money lent to them , and the prisoner applied for the loan of 5s . I refused to lend it , because he had not worked ; he said he had no money to live upon , and I told him that if he would work a short time I would lend him some ; he came to work after the 28th , and on the 3rd of May I went down with him . I came up with him on Monday the 7th , and I do not know that he again came on the mine till the next Wednesday , when I was sent for about ten o ' clock ; I was on the western part of the mine , and was sent for to come down to the smith's shop , where the prisoner was making a disturbance , having beat his wife and knocked down his sister ; he had his clothes in a bundle ; I told him he must leave the mine - that he should not work there any more ; he said he would not leave , and I went to put him off the mine , and said "" you have not a shilling to live upon , and why do you act in this way ? "" He said "" I can show more sovereigns than you can . "" I said "" where did you get sovereigns from - for it is very strange , as when you came here you were starving . "" He did not show me any ; I had not paid him any wages between the 28th of April and that time . Abel HARPER sworn : I am a miner living in Calstock , and working at Gunnis Lake Mine ; I know a beer shop kept there by a person called Doidge ; it is not very far from Gunnis Lake ; I was there on the 5th of May , and recollect seeing the prisoner there about nine o ' clock in the evening ; he asked me whether I would go to Tavistock with him the next day ; he said I should have a sovereign if I wanted it , to go along with him the next day ; I saw one sovereign ; I agreed to go with him ; I went with him and his brother . On the road to Tavistock we stopped at different homes and took refreshments for which the prisoner and his brother paid ; on the road between Gunnis Lake he showed me some sovereigns ; when we got to Tavistock , we had plenty to eat and drink ; we went to a shop where they sold drapery , and the prisoner and his brother purchased six silk handkerchiefs and two pair of stockings ; saw the money paid , but ca n't say how much ; we then went to a beer shop kept by Lamb , and the prisoner purchased a gun there ; the price of it was two sovereigns , and he paid for it in sovereigns ; then the prisoner also purchased the jacket he has on and a waistcoat and hat ; he gave £ 1 for the coat ; the hat cost 9s . , and he paid for both . His brother is a miner . We then went home , and I had as much meat and drink as I pleased ; he paid for all . William CROCKER examined : I am a constable and farmer residing at Calstock ; in consequence of the robbery I went in search of the prisoner with a person named Crab , and saw him in a public house at Calstock town ; I told him that he was suspected of the robbery , as , the day before , he had had money lavishing pretty freely ; he said he had not committed any robbery ; he said nothing else to me ; I took him into custody ; I went out to look after my horse , and was absent about a quarter of an hour ; on my return , Crab said the prisoner had said "" this is the hand that got the money , and Trevan shall never have it . "" I do n't recollect that the prisoner said anything to that ; all he said to me was that he had not done it . William CRAB corroborated the testimony given by Mr. Crocker , swearing distinctly to the confession made by the prisoner in Mr. Crocker's absence . The witness underwent a long cross-examination , by Mr. John , relative to his pursuits in life , from which it appeared he had twice been in the London police , but he had both times obtained leave to quit the service . He had , since then , occupied himself occasionally at his trade as a woolstapler , and had otherwise whiled away his leisure as a bailiff's follower . These things Mr. John did not forget to comment upon in his address to the jury , but the Learned Chairman afterwards said that there was nothing dishonourable in any of these pursuits when properly followed , as appeared to be the case in the present instance . The last witness called was Susan MORGAN , the mother-in-law of the prisoner , who stated that on the 9th of May , the prisoner paid her 24s . which he had owed her for nearly twelve months . Mr. John having addressed the jury , the Chairman summed up , and the jury found the prisoner guilty of the larceny but not of house-breaking . The Court sentenced him to seven years' transportation . On hearing his sentence , the prisoner said , with great nonchalance , "" I 'd rather be transported for life than go home to my wife .

200,1277,A7,"Ways to Customize your Jardin Puzzle Of course the first way to personalize your puzzle is to choose a picture , be it a photograph , a print , a map , a card or some thing else that is special to you or the person receiving the puzzle . Next you should decide how difficult the puzzle should be . If a puzzle is too hard , it 's not enjoyable . If it 's too easy , it 's not a challenge . The cutting style and features like irregular edges , color-line-cutting , figurals , and trick pieces all determine the degree of difficulty for a puzzle . Choosing a cutting style is matter of preference , desired degree of difficulty , and asthetics of matching the style to the image . I have customers that always request the same style just because they like it . Other customers want either an easy puzzle or a difficult one and choose accordingly . Sometimes , I just match the style to what looks good with the image . For example , for snowy images I sometimes use the Continuous Knob style ( see below ) because it looks like round clumps of snowflakes . I 've just added a new style I 've deemed "" Random fun "" . See why below . Most mass-produced paper puzzles use what is called a "" strip cut "" . The cardboard is die-cut using a two presses with metal cutting stripes , one aligned vertically , the other horizontally . Each interior piece interlocks with its 4 neighbors and has either a knob or a socket on all four sides . This cut is one of the easiest to assemble because of its regularity . The styles we offer make more difficult puzzles and produce puzzle patterns and individual pieces that are beautiful by themselves . Of course , we can do a strip cut as a special request , but the styles below are the main Jardin Puzzle styles . We 've added a new one at the end of the list . This cut is not done by strips but has wavy lines between "" knobs "" . Knobs can be round like doorknobs which we call a Random Knob cut . If they are shaped like the upper part of a heart ( or an ear on its side ) , the style is called Random Heart , and if the knob is a curl , we call it Random Curl . Random Heart cutting style Because of the random connecting lines , each piece has an arbitrary number of adjacent pieces instead of the "" four sides "" in a strip cut puzzle . Not knowing how many pieces border another and where the borders start and stop makes this type of puzzle more difficult to assemble than the strip cut . These cutting styles are made by continually cutting round knobs , hearts or curls with little or no connecting lines . A continuous cut of either knobs , hearts , or curls is the most difficult to assemble because the pattern is repetitive . Unlike the random styles , there are no semi-straight edges on either side of a "" knob "" to show how it fits together . Instead , the "" knobs "" interlock and it is not obvious where or how . Continuous Heart Style Continuous Knob Style These puzzles may be cut piece by piece , or in a maze-like section that is then cut into individual pieces The example below shows a small picture that has been cut into two sections using a continuous curl pattern . In particular , the Continuous Curl style results in beautiful scroll-like pieces . Curls and Knobs . We took our continuous curl and random knob and sort-of combined them . This style has the nice patterns of continuous curl , because it is cut in sections , not one piece at a time , but has a nice interlockability . It has "" wrenches "" , curly fronds that almost look plant-like , and "" shaved heads with big ears "" . See if you can find those patterns in the example below . Random Fun . The latest style we 've created I 've called Random Fun for two reasons . First , it 's fun to put together . Many of the pieces have unique and beautiful shapes , but there is no regularity as in the other patterns above . That 's the second reason it 's fun . It is cut at the whim of the cutter . I put in different types of interlocking pieces that pop into my head as I cut . This style is easier to assemble than the other styles because the pieces do n't resemble each other . It 's a good style to choose for a beginner to introduce them to the world of wooden puzzles without overwelming them with a "" challenge "" . It 's also good for the expert who just wants a favorite picture that s / he can put together for a quick puzzle break . Other cutting styles . The cutting styles mentioned above are our most popular . We do others like "" push fit "" or "" long round knob "" . For more information , we recommend an excellent survey paper on cutting styles written by Bob Armstrong that can be found on his website http://www.oldpuzzles.com . If you would like a style not mentioned here , just drop us an email . As the name implies , dropouts are portions of the interior of the puzzle that are intentionally cut out . Our best example of this technique is in our Iris Hispanica puzzle . Not only does it have a highly irregular edge , it has over 30 dropouts ! The black on the right hand side of the picture is the puzzle edge . All other black areas are interior dropouts . In addition to irregular edges , a puzzle may be cut along the color lines of the print . This makes the assembly more difficult since the usual clues of border pieces have been eliminated . There is a direct trade-off with interlock-ability and CLC . Unless the patterns of the colors are interlocking , cutting along the line of color introduces a semi-straight edge that is not interlocking with the rest of the puzzle . In the puzzle below , you can see the CLC around her hair , face and arms . Figurals , or as they were called in Britain , whimsies , began to be popular at about the turn of the 20th century . They were special pieces put in at the whim of the cutter . They were one piece or a multiple pieces . Today we design special figural peices to your request . They can either complement the puzzle image , or be a personal touch such a object from a favorite sport or hobby . The Reverie puzzle , pictured in the CLC section above , has single piece figurals and a multi-piece rose figural that follow a daydreaming theme : Figural pieces do n't have to be objects . We can put names , initials , dates or even a small message into your puzzle . The only limitations are space in the puzzle for the figurals , and interlockability if not enough regular pieces surround a figural . If a puzzle contains a large number of figurals , it will be easier to put together because the odd shapes give clues for adjacent pieces , and the puzzle may not interlock well if the figurals are convex shapes ( like balls for example ) . Most puzzle makers also have a special piece called a "" signature piece "" that is included with all puzzles . The signature piece for Jarden Puzzles is a stylized iris that is signed and dated on the back by the cutter , Melinda Shebell . A sliver dropout is just that . A very small sliver of wood is removed , usually in the shape of a figural or a pattern . When the puzzle is finally assembled , the outline of the image is present with a hint of enhance imagery . The example below , has 3 more sheep grazing in the field . Slivers make a puzzle more difficult because the pieces on either side almost , but do not , fit . Not until the entire region is completed is it obvious why the pieces are being contrary ! As the term implies , a puzzle may have disguised edge and corner pieces or interior pieces that appear to be a corner or edge . This adds to the delight and difficulty of the puzzle . The puzzle below has both interior edges and six apparent corner pieces , even though there are only two ! If the puzzle is color-line-cut , or has a patterned edge , the edge pieces may look just like the interior pieces . Which of the following pieces are corner and edge pieces ? Like the name implies , double cutting is when the cutter cuts two layers of puzzle at once . The result is that pieces will fit in two places . We use this technique when our customers want a really confusing puzzle . We combine it with tricky placement of our double cuts so that you might end up with a puzzle where all the pieces wo n't go together . You will then have to discover the double cuts and exchange pieces to get it correct . Our Limited Edition Wreath of Music puzzle has been especially designed with numerous double cuts so that the puzzle can be assembled in 2 ways . ( Well not really , it 's more than 2 but only two make recognizable shapes and use all the pieces ) Now that you 've read about a lot of things that go into a custom-cut jigsaw puzzle , how difficult do you want it ? Here are some guidelines : The strip cut is the easiest to assemble , the random knob , heart or curl cut is moderately difficult and the continuous knob , heart or curl cut is the most difficult . Regardless of difficulty , some pictures look better with certain cutting styles and this might be a consideration . For a given size puzzle and cutting style , smaller pieces are more difficult to assemble . Irregular edges , especially patterned edges , are more difficult to assemble . Color line cutting ( CLC ) may make it more difficult to assemble interior pieces . Interior dropouts , whether simply irregular sections within the picture , or negative silhouettes of figures or words , make the puzzle more difficult because no adjoining pieces can be found or the interior piece may look like an edge piece . Strict CLC almost always creates non-interlocking sections of a puzzle . You may want to specify moderate CLC to get both difficulty and interlockability . Figural pieces usually make a puzzle easier to assemble because of the irregular shaped pieces surrounding them . </doc>

134,381,A11,"Deep in the Bowels of Beit Basement ( June 1998 - October 1999 ) [ Photo Gallery ] In mid-1998 , a Union Sabbatical , who was also a member of Jazz and Rock society , happened to mention that they had a old room in the Beit basement that was n ' t in use . The committee of the time proceeded to make a nuisance of themselves until the society was given permission to take over this much larger room for the library . The room was a mess - cigarette ash several inches deep , the walls covered in eggboxes ( sound proofing ) , and some wooden construction in the middle of the room . After much effort ( and the smashing of a light fitting ) , the place was cleaned out and made ready for painting . The room became white with a dark blue network of piping . Two giant metal struts , studded with bolts , were carefully painted to resemble Daleks . It was a strangely industrial room , with large apparently random concrete blocks ( which made for good seating but inconvenienced shelf layout ) , an abundant selection of different pipes , complete with taps and broken-off ends , and one particularly large and complex ' feature ' ( a sewage output ? ) that was a real pain to paint . A large dragon mural ( "" Flarebright "" ) covered one stretch of wall , designed by karne , and painted by karne , Viv , and Liz . The door was covered with blackboard paint , so that ' useful ' messages could , theoretically , be written on it in chalk . A large sign declaring something about parking was obtained , and the back also painted with blackboard paint , and ICSF in large white letters . This started off on the door , but eventually made its way to in front of the TV . For this brief time when the society had possession of two rooms , people would occasionally adjourn to the new one to take advantage of the floor space to play Tragic . The room was only 10m or so away from the old library - down a tunnel on the left of the old library , which led under the Quad , past store rooms of Outdoor Club , Canoe , ?? , and opposite a room belonging to "" Tools for Self Reliance "" or various others . Karne notes : "" ownership varied wildly - mainly various charity groups and 3 world help people - I 'm convinced they kept stealing our paint .. "" It was at the end of the accessible corridor , approximately under the Beit Archway . Extract from Wyrmtongue , Oct. 1998 To find it , go to the Union Building , as you enter Beit Quad ( just after the archway ) you should turn left and continue walking until you reach some railings . On your right , is an iron staircase heading downwards . The library is actually in the basement , so go down the stairs and continue until you reach the white door , turn left and go through the brown door . You 'll find yourself in a twisty tunnel , turn right , then left and walk to the end of the corridor . The library is on your right and has a black-door covered in chalk . The tunnel continued , but was blocked by a locked door beyond which was a forbidden zone . However , sometimes this door was unlocked for mysterious reasons , and it was discovered that the tunnel continued down some rickety old wooden steps and right across the Quad , to join up to the NE corner of Beit . The tunnel had a similar unfinished , industrial feel to the room - numerous coloured wires and pipes showing in the ceiling and walls , loose planks with large gaps between them forming the floor , through which miscellaneous small items were occasionally lost . People were known to pull up these planks to retrieve dropped possessions , revealing a 1 . 5m deep grimy hole with yet more pipes . A blinking amber road light sat cheerily outside the new icsf library door , which was fortunate , as the corridor light seemed to break / become ' lost ' with surprising regularity . Being so close to the old library , the books were transferred by hand by a convoy of icsf committee and proto-committee . The shelves were bolted to the walls with power tools ( thanks to Alan ! ) . Several sets of cheap black metal shelves were bought - these turned out not to be such a good investment , as they tended to buckle under the weight of the books . It was resolved to buy the more expensive grey British Standard shelves next time . This new room served the society with distinction . It was huge , with ample room for all the shelves as well as a large area for sitting and watching TV . The stifling heat led to the purchase of a fan for the library ; a bin was also acquired to control the spread of Union curry . The room became almost respectable over the course of the next year , with the acquisition ( thanks to certain members of the society and monitoring of the , ahem , abandoned goods in Beit Quad ) of a wooden coffee table ( often used for Tragic ) , a really really nasty orange-brown sofa ( later binned on health & safety grounds by the Union ) , 5 good quality reception chairs , another swivel chair , a dusty green carpet , and even a fridge ( belonging to Adam , who did n't have room for it in his flat ) . The wooden stool and increasingly dead black swivel chair were also transferred to the new library , along with ( of course ) First and Second Stage , the video cabinets , and the nasty cushions . A large piece of mattress foam , minus any sort of covering , was also obtained and placed on one of the aforementioned concrete blocks as convenient seating for people watching the TV , or wanting somewhere to collapse . This piece of yellow foam was never covered , resulting in small pieces continually breaking off and being distributed around the floor and on people's clothing . ( Karne mutters something about Robin , a party , and a large amount of port , related in some way to a stain on the underside of the yellow foam . I do n't want to know . ) The walls were again covered with posters . Two large plastic ' trays ' of spare books were piled in the corner - these were duplicates of books already in the library , acquired from various donations . The library did n't want to keep these ( no room ! ) , but sold them to members at a minimal cost . Being in the same basement , this room suffered the same wildlife problems as the previous one , but for some reason it was less noticeable ( probably more chairs for them to hide under ) . However , Outdoor Club members were known to employ a hammer when entering their stores ( in the same corridor ) , in an attempt to take the cockroaches unawares . This library saw a lot of use during its year . It was frequently open outside official opening hours , turning into a common room for the members , who would turn up whenever they were in college without a lecture to go to . There were regularly 6-15 people in the library at lunchtimes , and much Babylon 5 was watched ( Robin having temporarily loaned his collection to the library ) . Unfortunately , this library also seemed to suffer more than its fair share of security problems in its short existence , possibly aided by the number of people going in and out . Certain valuable items were lost , as well as multiple left-over buckets of paint , and the entire Amber series by Zelazny . At one point the lock was forced , but ( thanks to Alan again ) it was replaced with a new one , plus much chemical metal , which solved that problem . In this year , the library was honoured by the temporary presence of the RCSU mascot , Theta . Several Theta bearers were active icsf members , and for a few weeks between public appearances , Theta ( a large and heavy thermometer ) resided among the shelves . Many of the pictures on this page were taken from a Half-Life map that was made - for more and larger pictures , see Mapping and Modelling - icsf Library .

1051,404,A14,"T5 : The Excavation Archaeological excavation began at T5 in April 2002 , with the construction work on the Terminal itself beginning in December 2002 ; the terminal is due to open in spring 2008 . The site is the largest ever excavated in Britain . It has also been innovative in the way that the archaeology has run alongside major construction work by BAA and in the way that interpretation of finds has taken place on site . No single archaeological unit had enough staff to tackle the project alone . Instead , two long-established practices , Oxford Archaeology and Wessex Archaeology , formed a joint venture called Framework Archaeology to work at T5 and all other BAA airports . The excavation was a major challenge to the staff , who worked amid the noise and fumes of the world's busiest international airport . The project was unique in the way that it integrated the archaeological and the commercial . Framework's staff spent seven years designing and planning the project and working in the Heathrow area . The result was a focussed way of carrying out archaeology which allowed the excavators to know which areas were important and so avoid wasting time and money . BAA encouraged the best archaeology possible . They hired archaeological consultant Gill Andrews and Professor John Barrett , from Sheffield University , who , together with Framework Archaeology , developed a unique working method at T5 . By analysing and recording finds on site during excavation , rather than waiting until the end as is usual , staff were able to interpret their findings as they were made as well as ensuring that their work followed the most interesting and important directions . The excavation was rare in having computer terminals onsite and its own post-excavation department . The excavation suggested that people first began to create fields owned individually , as opposed to farming communally on open land , as early as 2 , 000BC , some five hundred years earlier than has been thought . Some of the Bronze Age field boundaries remained in use until the airport was built in the 20th century . The excavation : revealed objects including the only wooden bowl found dating to the Middle Bronze Age ( 1 , 500BC-1 , 100BC ) ; one of only two wooden buckets from the same period ; and a log ladder leading down into a pit dug during the Middle Bronze Age containing a wooden axehaft and a Neolithic stone axe , itself 2,000 years old when it was placed there . Two beautiful Iron Age pottery cups were also found . shed new light on the development of farming during the Bronze Age . Farming began during the Neolithic - New Stone Age - period ( 4 , 000BC - 2 , 400BC ) when forests were gradually cleared and crops were planted and gathered communally . It had been thought that communal farming continued on open land until the Middle Bronze Age ( 1 , 500BC-1 , 100BC ) . However , at Terminal 5 , pollen found from hedges used as field boundaries showed that people here were creating fields with boundaries from around 2 , 000BC , during the Early Bronze Age , 500 years earlier than archaeologists have previously thought . revealed how the religious focus of people changed over the centuries . The excavation looked at the Stanwell Cursus , a four-kilometre ( 2 . 5 mile ) pathway about 20 metres wide and flanked by ditches , which was built as early as 3 , 800BC and cuts across the Terminal 5 site . The cursus was a pathway with religious significance which linked important sites . Archaeologists believe that processions took place of important members of tribes along the Stanwell Cursus and along several other shorter cursuses in the area . The excavation revealed that when the first field boundaries were created in the Early Bronze Age ( around 2 , 000BC - 1 , 500BC ) , they ran around the cursus and not across it , as a mark of respect for its religious significance . But during the Middle Bronze Age , from 1 , 500BC , field boundaries were created across the cursus itself , a sign that it was no longer venerated , and that people now had to live within a world defined by hedges and fields rather than communal living . At the same time , access to the local rivers for people's livestock was harder because it would mean driving them across others' land , so waterholes were dug instead . These then became the focus of religious rituals , with important objects such as pottery and wooden objects placed in them as a sign of their religious significance . These changes show how man changed the religious significance of sites according to how useful they were to early farming . charted the changes in the landscape made by man from 6 , 000BC . These included : pits where meat was cooked by hunter gatherers during the Mesolithic ( Middle Stone Age ) period , c6 , 000BC , when the landscape was heavily forested ; large cursuses created during the Neolithic era ( New Stone Age , 4 , 000BC-2 , 400BC ) ; fields and boundaries and the first small permanent settlements in the Bronze Age ( 2 , 400BC-700BC ) ; and a small village in the Iron Age ( 700BC-AD43 ) and Roman times . The excavation reveals how the settlement died out at the end of the Roman era , but another settlement appeared in the mid-12th century . Some of the field boundaries created in the Bronze Age are still visible on maps and were still in use in the 20th century . </doc>

40,161,A11,"I have a daughter , Mulan . And when she was eight , last year , she was doing a report for school , or she had some homework about frogs . And we were at this restaurant . And she said , "" So , basically , frogs lay eggs and the eggs turn into tadpoles , and tadpoles turn into frogs . "" And I said , "" Yeah . You know , I 'm not really up on my frog reproduction that much . It 's the females , I think , that lay the eggs . And then the males fertilize them . And then they become tadpoles and frogs . "" And she says , "" What ? Only the females have eggs ? "" And I said , "" Yeah . "" And she goes , "" And what 's this fertilizing ? "" So I kind of said , "" Oh , it 's this extra ingredient , you know , that you need to create a new frog from the mom and dad frog . "" And she said , "" Oh , so is that true for humans too ? "" And I thought , "" Okay , here we go . "" I did n't know it would happen so quick , at eight . I was trying to remember all the guidebooks , and all I could remember was , "" Only answer the question they 're asking . Do n't give any more information . "" So I said , "" Yes . "" And she said , "" And where do , where do human women , where do women lay their eggs ? "" And I said , "" Well , funny you should ask . We have evolved to have our own pond . We have our very own pond inside our bodies . And we lay our eggs there . We do n't have to worry about other eggs or anything like that . It 's our own pond . And that 's how it happens . "" And she goes , "" Then how do they get fertilized ? "" And I said , "" Well , Men , through their penis , they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out . And you go through the woman's vagina . "" And so we 're just eating , and her jaw just drops , and she goes , "" Mom ! Like where you go to the bathroom ? "" And I said , "" I know . I know . "" ( Laughter ) That 's how we evolved . It does seem odd . It is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an amusement park . Bad zoning . But ... She 's like , "" What ? "" And she goes , "" But Mom , but men and women ca n ' t ever see each other naked , Mom . So how could that ever happen ? "" And then I put my Margaret Mead hat on . "" Human males and females develop a special bond , and when they 're much older , much , much older than you , and they have a very special feeling , then they can be naked together . "" And she said , "" Mom , have you done this before ? "" And I said , "" Yes . "" And she said , "" But Mom , you ca n ' t have kids . "" Because she knows that I adopted her and that I ca n ' t have kids . And I said , "" Yes . "" And she said , "" Well , you do n't have to do that again . "" And then I said , "" ... "" And then she said , "" But how does it happen when a man and woman are together ? Like , how do they know that 's the time ? Mom , does the man just say , ' Is now the time to take off my pants ? ' "" ( Laughter ) And I said , "" Yes . "" ( Laughter ) "" That is exactly right . That 's exactly how it happens . "" So then we 're driving home , and she 's looking out the window , and she goes , "" Mom , what if two people just saw each other on the street , like a man and a woman , and they just started doing it . Would that ever happen ? "" And I said , "" Oh , no . Humans are so private . Oh no . "" And then she goes , "" What if there was like a party . And there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys . And there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it , Mom ? Would that ever happen ? "" And I said , "" Oh , no , no . That 's not how we do it . "" Then we got home and we see the cat . And she goes , "" Mom , how do cats do it ? "" And I go , "" Oh , it 's the same . It 's basically the same . "" And then she got all caught up in the legs . "" But how would the legs go , Mom . I do n't understand the legs . "" She goes , "" Mom , everyone ca n ' t do the splits . "" And I go , "" I know , but the legs ... "" I 'm like , "" The legs get worked out . "" And she goes , "" But I just ca n ' t understand it . "" So I go , "" You know , why do we go on the Internet , and maybe we can see ... "" like on Wikipedia . So we go online , and we put in cats mating . And , unfortunately , on Youtube , there 's many cats mating videos . And we watched them , and I 'm so thankful , because she 's just like , "" Wow ! This is so amazing . "" She goes , "" What about dogs ? "" So we put in dogs mating , and , you know , we 're watching it , and she 's totally absorbed . And then she goes , "" Mom , do you think they would have on the Internet , any humans mating ? "" ( Laughter ) And then I realized that I had taken my little eight year-old 's hand , and taken her right into Internet porn . And I looked into this trusting , loving face , and I said , "" Oh , no . That would never happen . "" Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you .

378,1251,A7,"The allure of the letters page is undeniable ; it 's the one place where the public can have their voices heard . But considering that hundreds of readers are competing for this space , how can you make sure your submission stands out ? Here 's 15 tips from our letters editor to help you get published . Shorter is always better To avoid taxing the editor's patience , and that of readers ' , submissions should be kept to 250 words . While at first it may seem difficult to express your groundbreaking thoughts in only a few paragraphs , keep in mind this limit is for your benefit . The more succinctly the point is made , the better the chance the letter will be read and remembered . Letters are n't mini columns Instead of trying to frame a complex argument , the best letters make a single point , convincingly yet briefly . If you can throw in a pithy observation or humorous twist along the way , all the better . Be topical We look for letters that address stories and issues currently on the minds of readers . You may still be angry about Jim Flaherty's flip-flop on income trusts , but unless there is a new development in this story , it 's no longer an issue for the letters page . Appeal to readers' emotions Some of our best letters come from people dealing with difficult situations . Last week , for example , we carried a handful of passionate letters from parents of children with Down syndrome . Readers sent in notes saying they were moved to tears by these letters , which stimulated both the heart and the mind . Draw from your own experience Do n't pen a letter that relies on quotes from outside authorities to make its point . We want to hear what you think , not what you read elsewhere . Your letter will be edited You could very well be the world's best writer , but be assured that your carefully selected prose will be fine-tuned by Post staff -- and probably shortened -- in the interests of clarity and space . Do n't take it personally , but instead consider it a learning experience for the next missive you send in . Eschew obfuscation Which is to say you should keep the language of the letter as simple and unpretentious as possible . We need exclusivity Do n't send your letter to numerous media outlets , thinking that will increase its chance of publication . That only achieves quite the opposite effect . Letters editors across the land , seeing the note is not unique to their paper , will just delete it . Play nice Do n't attack the personal views of a columnist , reporter or fellow letter writer . Instead offer a thoughtful countervailing opinion and try to advance the debate , which will encourage other readers to join in . Know the two-week rule In an effort to allow as many readers as possible to have their say on our pages , we aim to space out contributions by letter writers by at least two weeks . </doc>

288,1403,A12,"This card game contains 99 cards and follows the format of the original board game , focusing on specific problem or concerns of children . Like the original game , the card game is sure to help children communicate their feelings and develop insight into their problems . Full Description : The Talking , Feeling , and Doing Game - devised by Dr. Richard A. Gardner in 1968 and first published in 1973 - has enjoyed worldwide utilization as an extremely effective psychotherapeutic instrument . Most child therapist 's consider it an indispensable part of their playroom equipment . With a high degree of predictability , the game will engage the most resistant and inhibited children into meaningful psychotherapeutic endeavors . The game routinely facilitates disclosures often not otherwise obtainable . Further , the material elicited by the game serve as points of departure for meaningful psychotherapeutic interchanges . The game has proved helpful for shortening the psychotherapeutic process because quickly and predictably provides the therapist with information about the child's underlying psychological processes . Information that might have taken weeks or even months to elicit may even be obtained during the first few sessions . The game was originally designed to enable inhibited children to reveal themselves , but even children who are more freely engaged in direct discussion and insight-oriented therapy will find it a pleasurable additional psychotherapeutic experience . Sales of the game are restricted to qualified mental health professionals . Buyers must hold at least a Masters Degree in psychology , counseling , social work or a related field , and should have received appropriate clinical training in working with children or adolescents . Please include license number or the name of your graduate school , degree , and year graduated as part of the order . </doc>

418,1521,A16,"The Goldilocks Principle – Definition The Goldilocks Principle describes a situation that is "" just right "" rather than too much or not enough . This ideology is derived from the popular children's story and has been applied to many disciplines , including astronomy , biology , psychology , economics , and more . In astronomy , a Goldilocks Planet is one that is just the right distance from a star to be able to sustain life on the planet . In ecomonics , a Goldilocks Economy is one which sustains moderate growth and low inflation . In cognitive science or education , the Goldilocks Principle is observed when a task is neither too simple nor too complex for the learner to grasp . In medicine , The Goldilocks Principle is the ideal dosage of a drug for a particular patient based on their physiological needs . In each of these examples , optimal balance is reached within certain margins rather than reaching for extremes . In "" The Story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears "" each item in the cottage symbolizes a situation in Goldilocks's life that is out of balance . As she finds "" just right "" with the item , she discovers a state of "" just right "" within herself . Symbolically , the item serves as the medicine for a particular physical or energetic ailment in her life . The porridge provides physical nourishment . The chairs provide a sense of self as she "" takes her seat . "" The beds provide both physical rest and sleep as well as a sense of peace . Just as a doctor is considered on some levels a healer , the food , home , and energy of the bears in the cottage of this adaptation of the story is what heals Goldilocks of her ailments by bringing her to a state of equilibrium akin to The Goldilocks Principle . In this simple example , Goldilocks's encounter in the bears' cottage serves to bring "" just right "" to her root chakra ( food nourishment ) , her core chakra ( taking her seat in her Self ) , and her crown chakra ( sleep and dreaming in spirit world ) . </doc>

64,1433,A7,"Billboard rules of the road We 've pulled out all the stops to advertise the launch of our very own Ascend's Golden Guide . One of the ways we 've decided to advertise the publication and website is through four strategically placed billboards located next to highways throughout the Kansas City metro . Creating a successful billboard is actually more challenging than long-form content . Despite the large space , you have to get your message across instantaneously . Drivers often have fewer than 10 seconds to view . Here are six fundamental rules : Writing for billboards – or bus signs , meeting banners and other large signs meant to be seen from far away – is all about the short and sweet hook . Twitter's 140-character limit is a good introduction to writing concise content , but actually , the most eye-catching billboards are ones that feature seven words or less . It should be catchy and have an immediate effect on the reader . The best billboards hit a nerve with readers . Signs that elicit an emotional response are more memorable . Try the humorous approach , pull on their heartstrings or intrigue or surprise your readers . "" Good advertising is storytelling , "" according to the Outdoor Advertising Association of America ( OAAA ) . "" Dramatic tension or suspense influences viewer interest [ that ] can be expressed on three different cognitive levels : rational , emotional and cultural . "" Rely on imagery over words , if possible . For our billboard campaign , we chose to use a picture of the Ascend's Golden Guide cover for recognition , as the publication is now available in magazine racks at various locations , such as libraries , CVS pharmacies , doctor's offices and more , across the city . Think outside the billboard . Check with your billboard vendor to see if you can take your message or graphic past the frame . "" Extensions or other 3-D embellishments and environmental applications will enhance an overall design by producing greater impact , "" according to the OAAA . Fonts must be easy to read from variable distances . Make the text large and legible , paying close attention to the spacing between letters . For our billboard , which we wanted drivers to be able to read from the highway , we used Myriad , a sans-serif font . </doc>

492,1395,A1,"From James Whitlow regarding adult race leagues : "" In addition to the leagues you mentioned in the last edition , we also run derby races with a point system championship . We are in our 5th year . Check us out at www.sapcar.com From Stan Pope regarding "" Credibility of the Race "" in Volume 7 , Issue 4 : "" This article should be required reading for everyone who wants to ( or has to ) run a PWD race ! Lots of really great points in there ! A couple of observations : When participants stage their own cars , multiple elimination without charts is easier to run than any charted methods . And it produces higher heats per hour with less bother than charted methods . Accuracy is good . For instance , a quintuple elimination race gives high probability of correctly awarding the first 5 place trophies . Electronic finish lines malfunction at times . It is really bad when the organizer allows the mechanically recorded result to stand while the entire audience saw that it was wrong ! Even with the best electronics , there should be two finish line judges on duty to confirm or overrule the finish line electronics . But what should be done about disagreements ? Since heat reruns really slow the race progress and add unfair additional wear on the graphite , I like to combine these two observations as follows : For most of the racing , every judges' determination is honored ! If the three judges ( two human and one mechanical ) disagree , each of their choices is treated as though he won the heat ! This works very well with uncharted multiple elimination ! The cost is that sometimes an additional round of heats is required , depending on the number of cars running . The extra round affects everyone's lubrication equally . "" Can We Help ? 4 Testing for the maximum weight with a rear-weighted car would be problematic as the weight would need to be added in such a way that the balance point would not be affected . The test vehicle would need a device to move the weight back and forth in small increments to adjust the balance point at each test stage . A method of accurately measuring the balance point would also be needed . 5 Krytox 100 is available Here . Tube-O-Lube was used as the experiment was ran before Max-V-Lube was available . It is my belief that the general pattern would be repeated if other graphite lubes were used . 6 Ten ounces is the maximum weight the Wizard car can hold without changing the aerodynamics .

379,1631,A16,"As illustrated by the graph on the left , the basic symptoms of autism are often accompanied other medical conditions and challenges . These , too , can vary widely in severity . While autism is usually a life-long condition , all children and adults benefit from interventions , or therapies , that can reduce symptoms and increase skills and abilities . Although it is best to begin intervention as soon as possible , the benefits of therapy can continue throughout life . Social Challenges Typically developing infants are social by nature . They gaze at faces , turn toward voices , grasp a finger and even smile by 2 to 3 months of age . By contrast , most children who develop autism have difficulty engaging in the give-and-take of everyday human interactions . By 8 to 10 months of age , many infants who go on to develop autism are showing some symptoms such as failure to respond to their names , reduced interest in people and delayed babbling . By toddlerhood , many children with autism have difficulty playing social games , do n't imitate the actions of others and prefer to play alone . They may fail to seek comfort or respond to parents' displays of anger or affection in typical ways . It is common – but not universal – for those with autism to have difficulty regulating emotions . This can take the form of seemingly "" immature "" behavior such as crying or having outbursts in inappropriate situations . It can also lead to disruptive and physically aggressive behavior . The tendency to "" lose control "" may be particularly pronounced in unfamiliar , overwhelming or frustrating situations . Frustration can also result in self-injurious behaviors such as head banging , hair pulling or self-biting . Communication Difficulties By age three , most children have passed predictable milestones on the path to learning language . One of the earliest is babbling . By the first birthday , most typically developing toddlers say a word or two , turn and look when they hear their names , point to objects they want or want to show to someone ( not all cultures use pointing in this way ) . When offered something distasteful , they can make clear – by sound or expression – that the answer is "" no . "" By contrast , young children with autism tend to be delayed in babbling and speaking and learning to use gestures . Some infants who later develop autism coo and babble during the first few months of life before losing these communicative behaviors . Others experience significant language delays and do n't begin to speak until much later . With therapy , however , most people with autism do learn to use spoken language and all can learn to communicate . Many nonverbal or nearly nonverbal children and adults learn to use communication systems such as pictures ( image at left ) , sign language , electronic word processors or even speech-generating devices . When language begins to develop , the person with autism may use speech in unusual ways . Some have difficulty combining words into meaningful sentences . They may speak only single words or repeat the same phrase over and over . Some go through a stage where they repeat what they hear verbatim ( echolalia ) . Some mildly affected children exhibit only slight delays in language or even develop precocious language and unusually large vocabularies – yet have difficulty sustaining a conversation . Some children and adults with autism tend to carry on monologues on a favorite subject , giving others little chance to comment . In other words , the ordinary "" give and take "" of conversation proves difficult . Some children with ASD with superior language skills tend to speak like little professors , failing to pick up on the "" kid-speak "" that 's common among their peers . Conversely , someone affected by autism may not exhibit typical body language . Facial expressions , movements and gestures may not match what they are saying . Their tone of voice may fail to reflect their feelings . Some use a high-pitched sing-song or a flat , robot-like voice . This can make it difficult for others know what they want and need . This failed communication , in turn , can lead to frustration and inappropriate behavior ( such as screaming or grabbing ) on the part of the person with autism . Fortunately , there are proven methods for helping children and adults with autism learn better ways to express their needs . As the person with autism learns to communicate what he or she wants , challenging behaviors often subside . ( See section on Treatments . ) Repetitive Behaviors Unusual repetitive behaviors and / or a tendency to engage in a restricted range of activities are another core symptom of autism . Common repetitive behaviors include hand-flapping , rocking , jumping and twirling , arranging and rearranging objects , and repeating sounds , words , or phrases . Sometimes the repetitive behavior is self-stimulating , such as wiggling fingers in front of the eyes . The tendency to engage in a restricted range of activities can be seen in the way that many children with autism play with toys . Some spend hours lining up toys in a specific way instead of using them for pretend play . Similarly , some adults are preoccupied with having household or other objects in a fixed order or place . It can prove extremely upsetting if someone or something disrupts the order . Along these lines many children and adults with autism need and demand extreme consistency in their environment and daily routine . Slight changes can be extremely stressful and lead to outbursts Repetitive behaviors can take the form of intense preoccupations , or obsessions . These extreme interests can prove all the more unusual for their content ( e.g. fans , vacuum cleaners or toilets ) or depth of knowledge ( e.g. knowing and repeating astonishingly detailed information about Thomas the Tank Engine or astronomy ) . Older children and adults with autism may develop tremendous interest in numbers , symbols , dates or science topics . Associated Medical Conditions Thanks to donor support , Autism Speaks continues to fund research into the causes and treatment of the medical conditions associated with ASD . You can explore these studies here . This research is reflected in the comprehensive care model at the heart of our Autism Treatment Network ( ATN ) clinics . To find out if there is an ATN clinic close to you , click here . For in depth information on medical conditions , please see our website's related pages : "" Treatments for Associated Medical Conditions "" and "" What Treatments are Available for Speech , Language and Motor Impairments , "" in addition to the information below . Genetic Disorders Some children with autism have an identifiable genetic condition that affects brain development . These genetic disorders include Fragile X syndrome , Angelman syndrome , tuberous sclerosis and chromosome 15 duplication syndrome and other single-gene and chromosomal disorders . While further study is needed , single gene disorders appear to affect 15 to 20 percent of those with ASD . Some of these syndromes have characteristic features or family histories , the presence of which may prompt your doctor to refer to a geneticist or neurologist for further testing . The results can help guide treatment , awareness of associated medical issues and life planning . Gastrointestinal ( GI ) Disorders GI distress is common among persons with autism , and affects up to 85 percent of children with ASD . These conditions range in severity from a tendency for chronic constipation or diarrhea to inflammatory bowel disease . Pain caused by GI issues can prompt behavioral changes such as increased self soothing ( rocking , head banging , etc ) or outbursts of aggression or self-injury . Conversely , appropriate treatment can improve behavior and quality of life . Please see our treatment section on "" Gastrointestinal Disorders . "" It includes discussion of popular dietary interventions . Thanks to donor support , Autism Speaks continues to fund research into causes and treatments . Seizure Disorders Seizure disorders , including epilepsy , occur in as many as 39 percent of those with autism . It is more common in people with autism who also have intellectual disability than those without . Someone with autism may experience more than one type of seizure . The easiest to recognize is the grand mal , or tonic-clonic , seizure . Others include "" petit mal "" seizures ( when a person temporarily appears "" absent "" ) and subclinical seizures , which may be apparent only with electroencephalogram ( EEG ) testing . Sleep Dysfunction Sleep problems are common among children and adolescents with autism and may likewise affect many adults . For more information and helpful guidance , see our ATN Sleep Strategies Tool Kit ( available for free download ) . Sensory Processing Problems Many persons with autism have unusual responses to sensory input . They have difficulty processing and integrating sensory information , or stimuli , such as sights , sounds smells , tastes and / or movement . They may experience seemingly ordinary stimuli as painful , unpleasant or confusing . ( Explore our donor-funded research on causes and treatments here . ) Some of those with autism are hypersensitive to sounds or touch , a condition also known as sensory defensiveness . Others are under-responsive , or hyposensitive . An example of hypersensitivity would be the inability to tolerate wearing clothing , being touched or being in a room with normal lighting . Hyposensitivity can include failure to respond when one's name is called . Many sensory processing problems can be addressed with occupational therapy and / or sensory integration therapy .

763,893,A4,"Then he continued to rush forward as if frightened by the clatter of his own foot-steps . "" Whoa ! "" shouted Tip , picking himself up ; "" whoa ! you idiot whoa ! "" The Saw - Horse would probably have paid no attention to this , but just then it stepped a leg into a gopher-hole and stumbled head-over-heels to the ground , where it lay upon its back , frantically waving its four legs in the air . Tip ran up to it . "" You 're a nice sort of a horse , I must say ! "" he exclaimed . "" Why did n't you stop when I yelled ' whoa ? ' "" "" Does ' whoa ' mean to stop ?

"" Several , "" said Tip , briefly . "" But do keep those legs still . "" The Saw-Horse now became quiet , and held its legs rigid ; so that Tip , after several efforts , was able to roll him over and set him upright . "" Ah , I seem all right now , "" said the queer animal , with a sigh . "" One of your ears is broken , "" Tip announced , after a careful examination . "" I 'll have to make a new one .

216,1441,A12,"What 's in a name ? At MedShape , our name conveys our very essence : science driven medical devices that utilize the unique transformational capabilities of a new generation of biomaterials . These shape-changing devices are the perfect fit for the increasing number of minimally invasive procedures performed worldwide each year . Our vision , expertise and passion will continue the evolution of orthopedic surgery . Are you ready to evolve with us ? Interesting Fact Shape memory polymers are finding their way into everyday life . Potential new applications of SMPs in the automotive industry include self-repairing fenders that use heat from a household hairdryer to remove dents . Interesting Fact Nitinol was discovered by accident in 1961 at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory , hence the name Nitinol ( Nickel Titanium Naval Ordnance Laboratory ) . Nitinol has been used extensively in pipe couplers on F-14 fighter jets since the mid-1960s . SHAPE MEMORY POLYMERS ( SMPs ) Shape memory polymers ( SMPs ) are a relatively new class of "" smart "" materials . Shape memory polymers can "" remember "" multiple shapes and transition easily between those shapes when triggered to do so . SMPs can deform up to 400 % and still recover their original shape without a loss of mechanical integrity . Appropriate triggers for shape change include : heat ; light and mechanical force . Though researchers have developed numerous formulations of SMPs , MedShape is the only company to have developed and introduced FDA cleared devices manufactured from shape memory polymers based on PEEK ( polyetheretherketone ) and PMMA ( polymethylmethacrylate ) chemistries . Our proprietary PEEK Altera ® biomedical polymer allows devices to enter the target surgical site in a compact geometry and then be triggered to deploy , with minimal mechanical force , into the optimal geometry for fixation . Devices manufactured from PEEK Altera are biocompatible , biostable , radiolucent and MRI safe . SHAPE MEMORY ALLOYS ( SMAs ) Shape memory alloys ( SMAs ) have a history of successful human implantation in biomedical devices such as self-expanding cardiac stents , guide wires and orthopedic staples . Nickel-titanium ( NiTi , Nitinol ) is the most commonly used SMA and is capable of recovering strains up to 10 times more than traditional metals and alloys . SMAs have the ability to change their shape up to 8 % and still fully recover their original geometry . Fixation devices incorporating shape memory alloys can respond to local changes in the site of implantation , such as bone resorption , maintaining apposition of bony fragments and sustaining compression across fractures or fusion zones . We are the first company to clear through the FDA a bone fusion device comprised of both titanium and nickel-titanium , paving the way for a range of devices that are both strong and dynamic . </doc>

791,630,A11,"Story 2 - Taking a GAP year after being rejected This person decided to remain anonymous but wanted to tell their story to let people know taking a forced gap year can be a ' blessing in disguise ' ... In my previous application , I was n't 100 % certain that I really wanted to study medicine , and I was n't fully prepared . I think this showed in my PS ( personal statement ) . As the year went on , I was able to confirm that medicine is what I really want to do . Last year , I applied to 4 med schools with no backup choices . I was rejected after 2 interviews ( I was put on a waiting list at one ) . Obviously I was disappointed , but it did n't come as a surprise . I started to make plans for the next round , and by May , I was looking for jobs on the NHS website and it took about 4 months to find what I wanted to do - porter at my local hospital . ( This takes time so do n't leave it until the summer holidays ! ) I also started to look for GAP year medical volunteering opportunities abroad . Once I finished school , I started to volunteer at my local old people's home , 2 or 3 times a week , and I also started working for the NHS . My PS was more interesting the second time around , because I had more to write about . This time , I chose 3 different UNIs from my previous application , but I put down 1 UNI that I was rejected from last year , after interview . This was mentioned at my interview this time , and I was able to explain what I had been doing in my GAP year and what I was intending to do for the remainder of my GAP year . I also put down two back-up choices . I ended up with 4 offers after 3 interviews for medicine , and 1 offer for physiology . I withdrew from the last option ( another physiology course ) because they were taking too long to decide . This "" forced gap year "" has been a blessing in disguise for me ( except for the increase in the fees , of course ) . For one , I am now sure about my choice of course . Plus , I really enjoyed working as a porter in the NHS , and the extra cash that I 've saved up will be useful when I start Uni . So all in all , I 'm very pleased with the outcome . My advice would be to make the most of your GAP year by working or volunteering in medical environment , to strengthen your PS , but mainly , to make sure that medicine is what you really want to do . I am sure that you will be a stronger candidate the second time around , so best of luck to everyone ! </doc>

878,784,A14,"The cells that make up the nervous system die at two distinct times during the lifetime of an organism . These periods of neuron loss occur during embryonic development and also during ageing . Our research focuses on the factors that determine how , when and why neurons die at these times . The earliest stage of nervous system development is termed neurulation and at this time , neurons are already dying . Using Xenopus laevis as a model we are investigating what role this loss of cells plays in determining the future anatomy and physiology of the central nervous system . We are also considerating the effects that environmental agents have on cell death during neurulation and how this might relate to the development of neural tube defects such as spina bifida . Later on in embryonic development there is a wave of cell death as neurons innervate their target fields . We are investigating the intracellular and extracellular factors that control this in several populations of murine CNS neurons . Finally we are looking at the causes of cell death in ageing and neurodegenrative diseases with emphasis placed on Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease . Again we are interested in the intracellular and extracellular factors that control this loss of cells . In addition we are investigating factors that influence the physiology of these neurons . about linking to this page make changes to your own information </doc>

719,1488,A1,"Jed Moffitt did n't expect his IT services director role for Puget Sound's King County Library System ( KCLS ) to extend to leading Agile Web-based software development projects . Yet , today , development project planning is about 30 % of his job . The journey to that point was loaded with challenges : high demand for rapid application and new feature delivery , staff resistance , the pains of being an early adopter and , of course , a tight budget . Jed Moffitt "" Since the likes of Amazon and Google have become competitors for readers , libraries have to offer Internet services to be relevant , "" said Moffitt . He had to buck library systems' history of slow changes to take the 47-branch library system relevant in a time when so much of the information libraries used to provide is going online . The decision to build and customize KCLS applications for the Web positioned Moffitt as a pioneer . "" You 'd be hard-pressed to find another public library that would go this route , "" Moffitt said . He quotes the usual reactions from his long-time colleagues around the country : "" You 're developing software ? You 've got to be kidding me ! "" A history with software leads to open source tools Necessity had pushed Moffitt into software development before . Back in 1986 , Moffitt started working on library systems , transferring old-style , paper-based card catalogs into software catalogs . "" I used dumb terminals and computers with a half a K of memory , "" he said . From there , he moved to implementing software for "" the more squishy parts of the library process , "" he said . That meant automating how books were selected , bought , cataloged and tracked , among other things . He began doing custom programming and fixing bugs when he could n't get needed help from library software vendors' technical support . As Internet providers' popularity in e-book and information services became evident , Moffitt began evaluations of new integrated library systems ( ILS ) for KCLS . An ILS is essentially an enterprise resource management suite that 's customized for libraries . The KCLS team chose The Evergreen Project's Evergreen software , an open source , Linux-based ILS for its scalability and broad feature set , which included tools for managing , cataloging and circulating materials , no matter how large or complex the libraries . Evergreen being open source was a primary attraction . "" Commercial software vendors are really only incented to sell multiple versions of the same thing and sell licensing fees for it , "" he said . In addition , using open source software gives users the opportunity to do fixes , a desirable option considering Moffitt's experience with vendor support failures . KCLS chose an Evergreen Project-related service provider for application development , customization and deployment . "" We are n't resourced as a library development shop , and that 's not our strategy , "" he said . "" I 'm the responsible party for the overall technology for the system , the network , and the central servers , telephones , the enterprise resource stuff , the business office , and the accounting stuff , that kind of thing . "" The library's applications and services are hosted entirely in-house . Early adoption proves to be risky business Problems with the new ILS cropped up quickly . "" We created some of our own problems , being overly aggressive in our commitment , "" said Moffitt . Adopting Evergreen too early in its lifecycle meant sacrificing features and functions in the software that the outgoing system had . Getting new features or customizing existing ones was a slow process , largely because the technology provider used waterfall development . The librarians at King County became frustrated , because feature deliveries came too infrequently and were never entirely in sync with their needs and expectations . KCLS evaluated seven open source software and service providers . Large open source vendors could n't address KCLS's need for a nimble team to learn the ILS , and to start producing results at a reasonable pace and price . A development services firm in Tucson was considered , but the lower-cost Baltimore-based Catalyst IT Services was chosen . Agile to the rescue Cost did n't clinch the decision . Catalyst IT 's development methodology , Agile , did . The Agile approaches of short iterations and soliciting and acting on user feedback fit KCLS well . "" No more waiting for new features and fixes , even the simple things , to get done , "" said Moffitt . "" On a weekly basis , we 're actually changing the system based on our specifications . "" King County librarians have changed from contrarians to supporters of the ILS . "" Seeing this regular progress has allowed us to win over these stakeholders and involve them in the process in a very collaborative way , "" said Michael Rosenbaum , CEO of Catalyst IT Services . "" They 're now invested in the outcome of our work and feel a sense of ownership over each completed phase . "" There were some bumps along the way , particularly when Moffitt and Catalyst IT 's team wrestled with the ILS's complex GUI and had a couple of failed iterations . As a team , however , they 've gained expertise with the ILS and become fluent in fixing bugs and delivering new features . "" Catalyst IT gets an ' A ' for commitment , "" Moffitt said . Currently , Moffitt works with Catalyst IT on planning application development projects , and the latter does the actual development , deployment and related tasks . Another service provider in Washington handles KCLS database optimization and does testing when KCLS is sandboxing new applications . Based on his experiences in the ILS project , Moffitt offers these tips to his peers : Be wary of getting locked in to a one-provider services and software situation . Be diligent in business analysis and specification development before purchasing or developing software . Unless the business is happy with moving at a snail's pace , choose Agile development . Thanks to Agile development , Moffitt said , "" we 've quickly gotten out of chaos to where we can get into larger , more visionary projects . "" </doc>

295,1331,A16,"Building a disabled vehicle The disabled vehicle is all but invisible on the road these days because , surprise , surprise , it not only looks just like any other car , it really is like any other car ! You could n't spot it from Adam , whether travelling down the motorway or going to the doctor's surgery , or while doing the weekly shop at your local supermarket . And believe it or not , there are actually tens of thousands of wheelchair accessible vehicles on the roads of the UK on any particular day of the week . Surprised ? You should n't be . It 's been happening unnoticed by the able-bodied community for years , the conversion process which turns an ordinary car into one which a disabled person can make use of or even drive with ease . There are many companies across the country who not only do this work on a daily basis , but have been doing so for years , building a tremendous level of expertise in the process . Wheelchair accessible vehicle Let 's get one particular term out of the way right from the off . You may have come across it before – wheelchair accessible vehicle . Maybe not . It 's a bit of a mouthful , let 's face it , so it 's often shortened to the acronym WAV . It simply refers to a disabled vehicle capable of taking on board a person sitting in a wheelchair . The wheelchair user can be the actual driver of the car , because of all the adaptations available making this possible , or simply be the passenger , driven around by an able-bodied person whenever needed . It is possible to set up either scenario given the huge advances in the design of disabled vehicles nowadays . All WAVs start out as a ' base ' vehicle , the commercial version of the car anyone might buy from their local car dealer's showroom . Of course , not every vehicle is suitable for conversion into a WAV because of the extra safety requirements involved when carrying a wheelchair user . Safety is paramount and therefore an extremely rigorous program of testing is first carried out on any vehicle showing potential . Every aspect is examined , from road holding and engine performance to the amount of space available to both the wheelchair user and anyone else who might be on board . But no matter the vehicle , WAVs tend to have the same sorts of features , such as a means to allow the wheelchair user to get into and out of the vehicle with the minimum of fuss . This is usually achieved by means of a small ramp , normally fitted at the back , which is designed to be deployed easily and then stored away as unobtrusively as possible . The angle the ramp makes with the ground is crucial because the steeper it is , the more difficult it will be for the wheelchair user to go up and down it . A shallow angle is often achieved because part of the conversion process involves a lowering – and strengthening – of the vehicle's floor , necessary to take the extra weight of the wheelchair . And naturally , once inside , the wheelchair has to have a system to securely lock it into place . </doc>

269,66,A4,"Part One , Chapter 10 When Levin went into the restaurant with Oblonsky , he could not help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression , as it were , a restrained radiance , about the face and whole figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch . Oblonsky took off his overcoat , and with his hat over one ear walked into the dining room , giving directions to the Tatar waiters , who were clustered about him in evening coats , bearing napkins . Bowing to right and left to the people he met , and here as everywhere joyously greeting acquaintances , he went up to the sideboard for a preliminary appetizer of fish and vodka , and said to the painted Frenchwoman decked in ribbons , lace , and ringlets , behind the counter , something so amusing that even that Frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter . Levin for his part refrained from taking any vodka simply because he felt such a loathing of that Frenchwoman , all made up , it seemed , of false hair , poudre de riz , and vinaigre de toilette . He made haste to move away from her , as from a dirty place . His whole soul was filled with memories of Kitty , and there was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his eyes . "" This way , your excellency , please . Your excellency wo n ' t be disturbed here , "" said a particularly pertinacious , white-headed old Tatar with immense hips and coat-tails gaping widely behind . "" Walk in , your excellency , "" he said to Levin ; by way of showing his respect to Stepan Arkadyevitch , being attentive to his guest as well . Instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze chandelier , though it already had a table cloth on it , he pushed up velvet chairs , and came to a standstill before Stepan Arkadyevitch with a napkin and a bill of fare in his hands , awaiting his commands . "" If you prefer it , your excellency , a private room will be free directly ; Prince Golistin with a lady . Fresh oysters have come in . "" "" Ah ! oysters . "" Stepan Arkadyevitch became thoughtful . "" How if we were to change our program , Levin ? "" he said , keeping his finger on the bill of fare . And his face expressed serious hesitation . "" Are the oysters good ? Mind now . "" "" They 're Flensburg , your excellency . We 've no Ostend . "" "" Flensburg will do , but are they fresh ? "" "" Only arrived yesterday . "" "" Well , then , how if we were to begin with oysters , and so change the whole program ? Eh ? "" "" It 's all the same to me . I should like cabbage soup and porridge better than anything ; but of course there 's nothing like that here . "" "" Porridge à la Russe , your honor would like ? "" said the Tatar , bending down to Levin , like a nurse speaking to a child . "" No , joking apart , whatever you choose is sure to be good . I 've been skating , and I 'm hungry . And do n't imagine , "" he added , detecting a look of dissatisfaction on Oblonsky's face , "" that I sha n ' t appreciate your choice . I am fond of good things . "" "" I should hope so ! After all , it 's one of the pleasures of life , "" said Stepan Arkadyevitch . "" Well , then , my friend , you give us two – or better say three – dozen oysters , clear soup with vegetables ... "" "" Printaniere , "" prompted the Tatar . But Stepan Arkadyevitch apparently did not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the French names of the dishes . "" With vegetables in it , you know . Then turbot with thick sauce , then ... roast beef ; and mind it 's good . Yes , and capons , perhaps , and then sweets . "" The Tatar , recollecting that it was Stepan Arkadyevitch's way not to call the dishes by the names in the French bill of fare , did not repeat them after him , but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to himself according to the bill : – "" Soupe printanière , turbot , sauce Beaumarchais , poulard à l ' estragon , macédoine de fruits ... etc. , "" and then instantly , as though worked by springs , laying down one bound bill of fare , he took up another , the list of wines , and submitted it to Stepan Arkadyevitch . "" What shall we drink ? "" "" What you like , only not too much . Champagne , "" said Levin . "" What ! to start with ? You 're right though , I dare say . Do you like the white seal ? "" "" Cachet blanc , "" prompted the Tatar . "" Very well , then , give us that brand with the oysters , and then we 'll see . "" "" Yes , sir . And what table wine ? "" "" You can give us Nuits . Oh , no , better the classic Chablis . "" "" Yes , sir . And your cheese , your excellency ? "" "" Oh , yes , Parmesan . Or would you like another ? "" "" No , it 's all the same to me , "" said Levin , unable to suppress a smile . And the Tatar ran off with flying coat-tails , and in five minutes darted in with a dish of opened oysters on mother-of-pearl shells , and a bottle between his fingers . Stepan Arkadyevitch crushed the starchy napkin , tucked it into his waistcoat , and settling his arms comfortably , started on the oysters . "" Not bad , "" he said , stripping the oysters from the pearly shell with a silver fork , and swallowing them one after another . "" Not bad , "" he repeated , turning his dewy , brilliant eyes from Levin to the Tatar . Levin ate the oysters indeed , though white bread and cheese would have pleased him better . But he was admiring Oblonsky . Even the Tatar , uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate glasses , glanced at Stepan Arkadyevitch , and settled his white cravat with a perceptible smile of satisfaction . "" You do n't care much for oysters , do you ? "" said Stepan Arkadyevitch , emptying his wine glass , "" or you 're worried about something . Eh ? "" He wanted Levin to be in good spirits . But it was not that Levin was not in good spirits ; he was ill at ease . With what he had in his soul , he felt sore and uncomfortable in the restaurant , in the midst of private rooms where men were dining with ladies , in all this fuss and bustle ; the surroundings of bronzes , looking glasses , gas , and waiters – all of it was offensive to him . He was afraid of sullying what his soul was brimful of . "" I ? Yes , I am ; but besides , all this bothers me , "" he said . "" You ca n ' t conceive how queer it all seems to a country person like me , as queer as that gentleman's nails I saw at your place ... "" "" Yes , I saw how much interested you were in poor Grinevitch's nails , "" said Stepan Arkadyevitch , laughing . "" It 's too much for me , "" responded Levin . "" Do try , now , and put yourself in my place , take the point of view of a country person . We in the country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most convenient for working with . So we cut our nails ; sometimes we turn up our sleeves . And here people purposely let their nails grow as long as they will , and link on small saucers by way of studs , so that they can do nothing with their hands . "" Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled gaily . "" Oh , yes , that 's just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work . His work is with the mind ... "" "" Maybe . But still it 's queer to me , just as at this moment it seems queer to me that we country folks try to get our meals over as soon as we can , so as to be ready for our work , while here are we trying to drag out our meal as long as possible , and with that object eating oysters ... "" "" Why , of course , "" objected Stepan Arkadyevitch . "" But that 's just the aim of civilization – to make everything a source of enjoyment . "" "" Well , if that 's its aim , I 'd rather be a savage . "" "" And so you are a savage . All you Levins are savages . "" Levin sighed . He remembered his brother Nikolay , and felt ashamed and sore , and he scowled ; but Oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at once drew his attention . "" Oh , I say , are you going tonight to our people , the Shtcherbatskys ' , I mean ? "" he said , his eyes sparkling significantly as he pushed away the empty rough shells , and drew the cheese towards him . "" Yes , I shall certainly go , "" replied Levin ; "" though I fancied the princess was not very warm in her invitation . "" "" What nonsense ! That 's her manner .... Come , boy , the soup ! .... That 's her manner – grande dame , "" said Stepan Arkadyevitch . "" I 'm coming , too , but I have to go to the Countess Bonina's rehearsal . Come , is n't it true that you 're a savage ? How do you explain the sudden way in which you vanished from Moscow ? The Shtcherbatskys were continually asking me about you , as though I ought to know . The only thing I know is that you always do what no one else does . "" "" Yes , "" said Levin , slowly and with emotion , "" you 're right . I am a savage . Only , my savageness is not in having gone away , but in coming now . Now I have come ... "" "" Oh , what a lucky fellow you are ! "" broke in Stepan Arkadyevitch , looking into Levin's eyes . "" Why ? "" "" I know a gallant steed by tokens sure , And by his eyes I know a youth in love , "" declaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch . "" Everything is before you . "" "" Why , is it over for you already ? "" "" No ; not over exactly , but the future is yours , and the present is mine , and the present – well , it 's not all that it might be . "" "" How so ? "" "" Oh , things go wrong . But I do n't want to talk of myself , and besides I ca n ' t explain it all , "" said Stepan Arkadyevitch . "" Well , why have you come to Moscow , then ? .... Hi ! take away ! "" he called to the Tatar . "" You guess ? "" responded Levin , his eyes like deep wells of light fixed on Stepan Arkadyevitch . "" I guess , but I ca n ' t be the first to talk about it . You can see by that whether I guess right or wrong , "" said Stepan Arkadyevitch , gazing at Levin with a subtle smile . "" Well , and what have you to say to me ? "" said Levin in a quivering voice , feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering too . "" How do you look at the question ? "" Stepan Arkadyevitch slowly emptied his glass of Chablis , never taking his eyes off Levin . "" I ? "" said Stepan Arkadyevitch , "" there 's nothing I desire so much as that – nothing ! It would be the best thing that could be . "" "" But you 're not making a mistake ? You know what we 're speaking of ? "" said Levin , piercing him with his eyes . "" You think it 's possible ? "" "" I think it 's possible . Why not possible ? "" "" No ! do you really think it 's possible ? No , tell me all you think ! Oh , but if ... if refusal 's in store for me ! ... Indeed I feel sure ... "" "" Why should you think that ? "" said Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling at his excitement . "" It seems so to me sometimes . That will be awful for me , and for her too . "" "" Oh , well , anyway there 's nothing awful in it for a girl . Every girl 's proud of an offer . "" "" Yes , every girl , but not she . "" Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled . He so well knew that feeling of Levin's , that for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes : one class – all the girls in the world except her , and those girls with all sorts of human weaknesses , and very ordinary girls : the other class – she alone , having no weaknesses of any sort and higher than all humanity . "" Stay , take some sauce , "" he said , holding back Levin's hand as it pushed away the sauce . Levin obediently helped himself to sauce , but would not let Stepan Arkadyevitch go on with his dinner . "" No , stop a minute , stop a minute , "" he said . "" You must understand that it 's a question of life and death for me . I have never spoken to any one of this . And there 's no one I could speak of it to , except you . You know we 're utterly unlike each other , different tastes and views and everything ; but I know you 're fond of me and understand me , and that 's why I like you awfully . But for God's sake , be quite straightforward with me . "" "" I tell you what I think , "" said Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling . "" But I 'll say more : my wife is a wonderful woman ... "" Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed , remembering his position with his wife , and , after a moment's silence , resumed – "" She has a gift of foreseeing things . She sees right through people ; but that 's not all ; she knows what will come to pass , especially in the way of marriages . She foretold , for instance , that Princess Shahovskaya would marry Brenteln . No one would believe it , but it came to pass . And she 's on your side . "" "" How do you mean ? "" "" It 's not only that she likes you – she says that Kitty is certain to be your wife . "" At these words Levin's face suddenly lighted up with a smile , a smile not far from tears of emotion . "" She says that ! "" cried Levin . "" I always said she was exquisite , your wife . There , that 's enough , enough said about it , "" he said , getting up from his seat . "" All right , but do sit down . "" But Levin could not sit down . He walked with his firm tread twice up and down the little cage of a room , blinked his eyelids that his tears might not fall , and only then sat down to the table . "" You must understand , "" said he , "" it 's not love . I 've been in love , but it 's not that . It 's not my feeling , but a sort of force outside me has taken possession of me . I went away , you see , because I made up my mind that it could never be , you understand , as a happiness that does not come on earth ; but I 've struggled with myself , I see there 's no living without it . And it must be settled . "" "" What did you go away for ? "" "" Ah , stop a minute ! Ah , the thoughts that come crowding on one ! The questions one must ask oneself ! Listen . You ca n ' t imagine what you 've done for me by what you said . I 'm so happy that I 've become positively hateful ; I 've forgotten everything . I heard today that my brother Nikolay ... you know , he 's here ... I had even forgotten him . It seems to me that he 's happy too . It 's a sort of madness . But one thing 's awful .... Here , you 've been married , you know the feeling ... it 's awful that we – old – with a past ... not of love , but of sins ... are brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent ; it 's loathsome , and that 's why one ca n ' t help feeling oneself unworthy . "" "" Oh , well , you 've not many sins on your conscience . "" "" Alas ! all the same , "" said Levin , "" when with loathing I go over my life , I shudder and curse and bitterly regret it .... Yes . "" "" What would you have ? The world 's made so , "" said Stepan Arkadyevitch . "" The one comfort is like that prayer , which I always liked : ' Forgive me not according to my unworthiness , but according to Thy lovingkindness . ' That 's the only way she can forgive me .

995,1387,A16,"The MOST satellite design originates from trying to fit as large a telescope as possible , all the electronics to interface with the telescope , the satellite bus equipment that allows the storage and transmission of the science data to the ground , the ACS hardware that is required to maintain better than 25 arcsecond pointing accuracy for the telescope , and a power system to provide enough power to the satellite , all into a package that can meet the requirements for launch as a secondary payload on a Delta II launch vehicle ( with Radarsat-2 as the primary payload ) . It probably bears little resemblance to the satellite design that would have resulted had a launch on the Rockot been planned from Day 1 . However , that is the nature of microsatellite design . The telescope is a 15cm diameter aperture Maksutov telescope . A periscope mirror allows the long axis of the telescope to lie perpendicular to the aperture of the telscope and therefore fit into the Delta II secondary payload physical constraints . Attached to the telescope , separate from the satellite bus structure , is a two stage passive cryocooler that is capable of maintaining the focal plane of the telescope at a temperature of -40 ° C. Covering the aperture of the telescope is a door that is designed to actively close to protect the instrument focal plane from direct sunlight . The satellite structure is based on a tray stack design . The structure consists of aluminum trays that house the satellite's electronics , battery , radios , and attitude actuators . These trays are stacked forming the structural backbone of the satellite . To this backbone , the telescope is mounted with its barrel parallel to the axis of the stack . Six aluminum honeycomb panels , acting as substrates for solar cells and carriers for attitude sensors , enclose the tray stack / telescope assembly . An actuated telescope door mounted on the star facing side of the satellite protects the telescope focal plane from direct stares at the Sun should the satellite tumble or lose attitude lock . </doc>

201,710,A1,"The theory and practice of the Socialist Workers Party - a critical assessment - Part IV "" Callinicos's stance is limited to opposing a timeless abstraction defined as American imperialism . So he glosses over the important structural connections between American imperialism and the transnational corporations . Instead America is seen as a nation of reactionary geopolitical values and envisaged by Callinicos as the political antagonist of the people of the world "" By Phil Sharpe Alex Callinicos defines imperialism in a manner which he holds to be compatible with the traditional Leninist theory of imperialism . He maintains that despite the increasing internationalisation of production there is still a predominantly national basis to economic development , and this is upheld by the role of the nation state . This explains the continuation of inter-imperialist rivalry : "" Although the pronounced tendency towards the global integration of capital over the past generation has severely reduced the ability of states to control economic activities within their borders , private capitals continue to rely on the nation state to which they are most closely attached to protect them against the competition of other capitals , the effects of economic crisis and the resistance of those they exploit . "" 1 In this context , we can understand economic and political tensions and rivalries between USA imperialism with Germany and Japan , and countries like Russia are also potential imperialist contenders . 2 John Rees , who plays a leading role in the Stop the War Coalition on behalf of the Socialist Workers Party , refines and elaborates this conception . He contends that the international development of the productive forces can only be understood in the context of competition between nation states and rival trading blocs : "" Since capital can only exist as many competing capitals , it still needs a state that can try to stand above the fray and attempt to regulate competition . The move to international capital does not dispense with this requirement , but raises it to the level of conflict between states and trading blocs . "" 3 What is significant about these definitions of imperialism , is that they are very much based upon geopolitical considerations connected to the important role of the nation state as a protector of national capital . What is missing is an indicator of what is the structural content of economic development . This criteria is important , because it will help to show what has possibly changed since the time of Lenin when the classical theory of imperialism was elaborated . Lenin showed that the structural content of imperialism was based upon the role of monopoly capital and finance capital , or the merging of industrial and banking capital . Monopoly capital and finance capital tended to be nationally organised , and this was crucial in explaining imperialism because the nation state became a protector of the interests of its "" own "" national monopoly capital . The recent globalisation of production and commerce is structurally dependent upon the role of transnational corporations , which are no longer based upon a particular nation state . This does not mean that the role of the nation state has become superfluous , or that inter-imperialist rivalries are transcended , but it does mean that economic development is no longer based upon rival trading and political empires that aim at the protection of the interests of monopoly capital . Instead , because of the growth of transnational corporations , capitalism has become a more integrated economic system . This is shown by the development of international financial institutions that express this global logic , such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . Given the transformation of national monopoly capital into transnational capital , it has been possible for the national political representatives of capital to co-operate in unprecedented terms , something that would have been inconceivable in the era of nationally organised and competitive monopoly capital . For it is in the interests of the transnationals that political co-operation and unity is created between the advanced capitalist countries in order to enhance the possibility of exploiting the labour of all countries . This does not mean that imperialism has turned into ultra-imperialism , bringing with it the possibility of a connected , peaceful and co-operative development of capitalism . Instead the development of global capital represents a new phase in the imperialist stage of capitalism . For what is occurring is the intensification of the exploitation of the labour of those subordinated and dominated countries within the hierarchical levels of the world economy . Imperialism , therefore , remains an expression of a relation of exploitation and oppression of oppressed nations , despite the important gain of political independence in the period of colonial liberation . But the structural content of this imperialism is changing . It is no longer primarily based upon antagonistic and rival national monopoly capitals , but the standpoint of the transnational corporation . Have the SWP modified their stance in the recent period ? The short answer to this question is no . If anything the SWP has become more dogmatic about adhering to the "" Leninist "" theory of imperialism . In an article about the foreign policy of the Bush administration , Callinicos argues that the tendency towards unilateralism , or a go-it-alone stance , is connected to a geopolitical imperative for American imperialism to maintain its military superiority over rivals like Russia and China : "" Their world-historical perspective leads the Bush team to conclude that a window of opportunity has opened in which they can use the US's present military superiority to improve the long-term position of US capitalism . "" 4 However , Callinicos then makes an eclectic qualification to this view , in that he concedes that US foreign policy does not just have this geopolitical aspect of consolidating hegemony over potential rivals , but it is also related to the requirements of globalisation : "" It is important , however , to see that the Bush administration's grand strategy is aimed not simply at maintaining US geopolitical pre-eminence , but at imposing the Anglo-American model of free market capitalism on the world . "" 5 So , Callinicos glosses over any theoretical inconsistency between these two comments by reducing globalisation to an ideology or policy . In this manner he can equate globalisation with the exclusive interests of American foreign policy , and therefore tenuously maintain his geopolitical view about imperialism as essentially the rivalry between competing nation states . How can we explain the inconsistency in Callinicos's view ? Empirically , he feels impelled to admit the significance of globalisation and the impact of the growing internationalisation of production and the circulation of money . But , theoretically and politically he has to reduce this empirical admission to the dogmatic views of the SWP about the primacy of inter-imperialist rivalry . Thus he still defines the present role of USA capital as nothing more than trying to maintain an increasingly precarious economic hegemony over inter-imperialist rivals : "" The US's huge military lead over the other powers should not be allowed to conceal the fact that the economic contest , particularly with the EU , is much more evenly balanced . The implication is that the current US supremacy depends on a highly contingent and transitory set of circumstances . It is precisely for this reason that US administrations have had to fight hard to maintain their hegemony - first of Western capitalism , now on a global scale - over the past generation . The Bush administration is seizing advantage of the present conjuncture in order to shift the terms further in the favour of US capitalism "" . 6 But an important question can not be answered by this essentially geopolitical analysis , which explains economic and politics in terms of the competition between rival nation states . This question is : what precisely is American imperialism upholding and defending ? The answer to this question is the power and importance of the transnational corporation , which constitutes the structural basis of the increasingly interdependent world economy . In contrast , Callinicos's answer amounts to an evasion and tautology , because what he is essentially suggesting is that competitive nation states protect the competitive character of capital . This answer does not tell us about the historical context and process of development of this competition . The unarticulated assumption of Callinicos is that American imperialism , and the various rival imperialisms , are based upon nationally-organised monopoly capital and finance capital . But this assumption is antiquated , because it lags behind recent economic and structural development , which is based upon the evolution of monopoly capital into the transnational corporation . This does not mean that competition has been transcended , but rather competition is now between forms of capital that are not necessarily and organically connected to a national content . In this context , it is possible to consider that far from the national state being compatible with the present structural character of capitalist development , there is instead a contradiction between the nation state and the economic requirements of global capital . In other words , the state is increasingly becoming an anachronism , or an ideological and political construct which contradicts the requirements of the highest economic trends of capitalist development . The state still acts to protect the interests of capital , but this is carried out in antiquated terms , which means the contradiction between ideological and political requirements and the role of the economic are not resolved . Instead this contradiction is intensified , and so the ideological and political interests of the nation state are in conflict with the requirements of national capital . In order to try and resolve this contradiction , American imperialism has advocated the policy of unilateralism , to try and assert that the global interests of capital are best served by the military might of America . But this stance has only intensified the political and ideological contradictions between the advanced capitalist countries , because European countries , such as France and Germany , also maintain that they also uphold the interests of global capital . What seems on the surface an expression of renewed inter-imperialist rivalry , is actually a manifestation of the structural problem that the economic process of globalisation has in developing compatible political and ideological forms . Callinicos contends that globalisation has not transcended the assertion of national interests , such as expressed by the unilateralism of American imperialist foreign policy . 7 The economic crisis of Germany and Japan in the 1990s helps to explain the resurgence of American imperialism as a power capable of imposing hegemonic and unilateral military action , he argues . Also Russia and China do not yet have the economic power to challenge America . 8 In this context , the Clinton era could be considered as a transitional era , because multilateral action at the level of the UN and NATO was increasingly replaced by unilateral action . This situation was reinforced by the advent of the Bush administration that was always committed to unilateralism . Since September 11th this stance was extended by the Bush doctrine of pre-emptive strike against "" rogue states "" . 9 Thus the Bush administration is committed ideologically to Reaganism , and its doctrine of the use of USA military power to suppress potential or actual rivals . 10 A tension has developed , therefore , between a Europe - with the main exception of the UK - committed to multilateral action and a Bush administration based on a commitment to its own unilateral military power . 11 This analysis shows that Callinicos has failed in his attempt to combine the "" complex mixtures of economic and geopolitical reasons "" for the actions of imperialist powers . 12 Instead what he has done is abstract out the importance of the geopolitical reasons for the unilateralism of American imperialism and then project or impose this descriptive analysis onto the process of economic causation Thereby he has constructed an idealist inverted relation between the geopolitical and the economic . The geopolitical becomes the basis for explaining the economic , rather than the economic being the basis for developing an analysis of the role of the geopolitical . In contrast , the tensions between American unilateralism and European multilateralism only become consistently explanatory when this situation is connected to the political conflict between different states about how best to defend the interests of global capital . What is the best geopolitical policy that can best uphold the interests of transnational capital ? At present , from the standpoint of capital , there does not seem to be any definite and definitive answer to this question , and so the result is political and ideological tensions between France , Germany and Russia with America and Britain . But in the last analysis this tension will not break out into fully fledged inter-imperialist rivalry , because the structural context is not that of competition between national monopoly capital . Instead it concerns the strategic question of how the nation state of the advanced capitalist countries can best advance the interests of transnational capital . In relation to the situation in Iraq , Callinicos maintains that the immediate aim of the Bush administration is to show any other possible political antagonists that they will be dealt with punitively like Iraq . It is also strategically and economically important to realise USA's economic control of Iraqi oil in the context of growing distrust between Saudi Arabia and America . 13 Control of Iraqi oil will advance both American imperialism's economic and geopolitical interests against its European and Japanese rivals : "" Not only would this ease concerns about the US's long term access to oil , it would also increase Washington's leverage over allies and rivals such as Germany and Japan that are even more dependent than the US on imported oil . Once again we see how economic and geopolitical considerations are inextricably interwoven in the grand strategy of US imperialism . "" 14 Callinicos accepts that there is criticism of the Bush approach within the American ruling class , in that potential allies for coalition building are being alienated by the unilateralist approach . 15 However , despite the risks and problems , the strategy of the Bush administration is not irrational , because it is based on the need to use American military power in order to shift the global balance of power in its favour . 16 In order for this above viewpoint to have any credibility a situation would have to develop , in which the American government directly controlled the Iraqi oil fields , and on that basis control the level of supply to Europe and Japan . But this will not happen , not least because the direct economic role of the state is generally considered by the American government to be against the interests of capital . Instead an important aim of American unilateralism is to bring about control of the Iraqi oil fields by the transnational corporations because the present role of the Iraqi state is considered against the interests of global capital . The strategic military tensions between America and Europe about unilateral or multilateral action against Iraq are , therefore , not an expression of inter-imperialist rivalries about who could nationally control Iraq's oil . For the governments of both Europe and America are equally committed to realising a situation of enhancing the capacity of the transnationals to control the supply of Iraq's oil . Consequently , a shared economic aim to realise the greater economic integration of Iraq into the global economy has led to strategic military and political differences between Europe and America about how to realise this aim . Callinicos tries to defend his standpoint by suggesting that unilateralism is the best way to uphold the strategic interests of American imperialism against its rivals . But this contention lacks substance because the world economy is not dominated by nationally competing rival monopoly capital centres . Furthermore , if the world economy was still predominantly based upon rival monopoly capital , it would actually be irrational for American imperialism to rigidly pursue foreign policy objectives by unilateralist means that needlessly alienated allies and potential rivals . America's unilateralist foreign policy can only be conceived as rational if it is located in the context of strategic differences about what is the best policy to realise the interests of global capital . The American government is preparing to take the risks of renouncing multilateralism precisely because it regards this strategy as increasingly unable to decisively advance the interests of global capital . Consequently , the Bush administration regards the adherence to multilateralism and the UN by France and Germany as support for an ineffective policy that will not enhance the realisation of the objective of upholding the interests of global capital and the transnationals . The present tension between Europe and America is an expression of the fragmentation of the nation state system in relation to the growing economic interdependency of global capital . Callinicos concludes by commenting that the Bush strategy has resulted in a diverse international opposition to the war drive against Iraq , and led to illusions in the role of Europe limiting the actions of America . 17 That is why the opposition to the war is heterogeneous , and some people have illusions in the UN and global capitalist values , but the logic is for increasing political radicalisation and the development of an anti-imperialist stance . It is necessary to develop a united front of these diverse political forces and provide a revolutionary anti-imperialist leadership , says Callinicos , adding : "" Part of the point of the united front tactic is to unite politically diverse forces in action around a limited common objective : within this united front it is the responsibility of revolutionary socialists both to try to make this struggle as militant as possible and to challenge the political illusions that still tie some of the participants to the ruling order . The political climate today , certainly in Britain , is one where , simultaneously , opposition to the war on Iraq is very broad , but it is the anti-imperialist wing of the movement that is making the running . "" 18 Callinicos formally tries to defend revolutionary politics , by opposing any support for Europe against America . In this context , he is trying to deny that the standpoint of the SWP also defends illusions in a progressive Europe against a reactionary America . However , the dogmatic , descriptive and one-sided geopolitical analysis of Callinicos , with its emphasis on the role of American unilateralism , is actually an ideological accommodation to the view that a left-wing capitalist class in Europe can be mobilised against a right-wing administration in America . By contrast , if we locate the role of the Bush administration , and France and Germany , within the context of defending capital against the interests of labour , then we can develop a more principled internationalist and intransigent stance . On that basis the anti-imperialist necessity to oppose the war against Iraq is connected to the necessity to develop a strategy that facilitates the struggle of the world working class and peasantry against the interests and policies of the transnational corporations and global capital . In comparison Callinicos's stance is limited to opposing a timeless abstraction defined as American imperialism , and so he glosses over the important structural connections between American imperialism and the transnational corporations . Instead America , as a nation of reactionary geopolitical values is effectively envisaged by Callinicos as the political antagonist with the people of the world . Callinicos maintains that his approach is based upon the united front , or mass mobilisation around limited and defensive demands which then can develop an anti-capitalist logic . But the conception of the united front , as developed by the early Third International and by Trotsky , was based upon the interaction of principled politics with the need for flexible tactics in relation to the question of mobilising the working class against capitalism . The dogmatic conception of imperialism upheld by the SWP is not conducive to developing principled politics and providing revolutionary leadership of a united front . In fact , it more resembles the Popular Front developed by Stalinism in the 1930s , where alliances were made across the class spectrum with fatal political results . The SWP is defending lowest common denominator politics in order to try to organisationally obtain the maximum possible influence within a mass movement . Consequently , the SWP is actually opposed to developing the principled politics necessary to transform the anti-war movement into an expression of conscious opposition to both imperialism and capitalism .

161,1454,A7,"Military Provisioning Guardian 6 Recommendations . 1 : Increasing long-term federal investment in high-technology industries , particularly those involving advanced research and manufacturing capabilities . The distinguishing attribute of the U.S. defense industrial base is technological innovation . As foreign nations continue manufac ¬ turing an ever-larger share of America's defense supplies , the United States increases its risk of diminishing its capacity to design and commercialize emerging defense technologies . To help ensure that our armed forces dominate the future battlefield , Congress should provide funding for American manufacturers to develop and implement advanced process technologies . 2 : Properly applying and enforcing existing laws and regulations to support the U.S. defense industrial base . Domestic source preferences already enacted into law , such as those that apply to the steel and titanium industries under the Specialty Metals Clause , must be retained to ensure that important defense capabilities remain secure and available for the U.S. armed forces . 3 : Developing domestic sources of key natural resources required by our armed forces . Right now the United States relies far too heavily on foreign nations for certain key metals and other raw materials needed to manufacture weapons systems and other military supplies . For example , most rare earth elements , which are essential components of many modern military technologies , currently must be purchased from China . The U.S. government and industry must stockpile these vital raw materials , strengthen efforts to resume mining and transformation of the materials in the United States , improve recycling to make more efficient use of current supplies , and identify alternate materials . 4 : Developing plans to strengthen our defense industrial base in the U.S. National Military Strategy , National Security Strategy , and the Quadrennial Defense Review process . This would make creating and sustaining a healthier defense industrial base a higher national priority , with a focus on increasing support for the most important and vulnerable industrial sectors . 8 : Crafting legislation to support a broadly representative defense industrial base strategy . Congress and the Administration must collaborate on economic and fiscal policies that budget for enduring national security capabilities and sustain the industrial base necessary to support them . 9 : Modernizing and securing defense supply chains through networked operations . These operations should be built on the excellent work that the DOD and industry are already doing to map and secure defense supply chains . The operations would provide ongoing communications between prime contractors and the supply chains they depend on . Closer communications , patterned on the networked operations of U.S. military forces around the world , would help managers identify and solve recurring problems with military supplies . 10 : Identifying potential defense supply chain chokepoints and planning to prevent disruptions . This recommendation would require determining the scope of foreign control over critical military supply chains and finding ways of restoring U.S. control . Subscribe Now ! </doc>

729,20,A1,"The "" Browning "" of African Technology Forget MIT . Hello , Tsing Hua University . For Clothilde Tingiri , a hot young programmer at Rwanda's top software company , dreams of Beijing , not Cambridge , animate her ambitions . Desperate for more education , this fall she plans to attend graduate school for computer science – in China , not America . The Chinese are no strangers to Rwanda . Near Tingiri's office , Rwanda's largest telecom company , Rwandatel , is installing new wireless telephony equipment made by Huawei of Shenzen . Africa boasts the world's fastest-growing market for wireless telephony , and Huawei – with offices in 14 African countries – is running away with the business , sending scores of engineers into the bush to bring a new generation of low-cost technology to some of the planet's poorest people . Motivated by profit and market share rather than philanthropy , Huawei is outpacing American and European rivals through lower prices , faster action , and a greater willingness to work in difficult environments . According to Chris Lundh , the American chief of Rwandatel , "" That 's the way things work in Africa now . The Chinese do it all . "" Well , not quite . Across sub-Saharan Africa , engineers from India – armed with appropriate technologies honed in their home market – are also making their mark . India supplies Africa with computer-education courses , the most reliable water pumps , low-cost rice-milling equipment , and dozens of other technologies . The sudden influx of Chinese and Indian technologies represents the "" browning "" of African technology , which has long been the domain of "" white "" Americans and Europeans who want to apply their saving hand to African problems . "" It is a tectonic shift to the East with shattering implications , "" says Calestous Juma , a Kenyan professor at Harvard University who advises the African Union on technology policy . One big change is in education . There are roughly 2,000 African students in China , most of whom are pursuing engineering and science courses . According to Juma , that number is expected to double over the next two years , making China "" Africa's leading destination for science and engineering education . "" The "" browning "" of technology in Africa is only in its infancy , but the shift is likely to accelerate . Chinese and Indian engineers hail from places that have much more in common with nitty-gritty Africa than comfortable Silicon Valley or Cambridge . Africa also offers a testing ground for Asian-designed technologies that are not yet ready for US or European markets . A good example is a solar-powered cooking stove from India , which has experimented with such stoves for decades . Wood-burning stoves are responsible for much of Africa's deforestation , and , in many African cities , where wood accounts for the majority of cooking fuel , its price is soaring . The Indian stove is clearly a work-in-progress ; it is too bulky and not durable enough to survive the rigors of an African village . But with India's vast internal market , many designers have an incentive to improve it . How many designers in America or Europe can say the same ? Of course , technology transfer from China and India could be a mere smokescreen for a new "" brown imperialism "" aimed at exploiting African oil , food , and minerals . In recent years , China's government alone has invested billions of dollars in African infrastructure and resource extraction , raising suspicions that a new scramble for Africa is underway . But Africans genuinely need foreign technology , and the Chinese , in particular , are pushing hard – even flamboyantly – to fill the gap . This year , Nigeria's government bought a Chinese-made satellite , and even paid the Chinese to launch it into space in May . China was so eager to provide space technology to Africa's most populous country that it beat out 21 other bidders for a contract worth $ 300 million . China's technology inroads are usually less dramatic , but no less telling . In African medicine , Chinese herbs and pharmaceuticals are quietly gaining share . For example , the Chinese-made anti-malarial drug artesunate has become part of the standard treatment within just a few years . Likewise , Chinese mastery over ultra-small , cheap "" micro-hydro "" dams , which can generate tiny amounts of electricity from mere trickles of water , appeals to power-short , river-rich Africans . Tens of thousands of micro-hydro systems operate in China , and nearly none in Africa . Americans do-gooders like Nicholas Negroponte , with his $ 100 laptop , have identified the right problem : Africa is way behind technologically and rapid leap-frogging is possible . But Chinese and Indian scientists argue that Africa can benefit from a changing of the technological guard . They may be right . </doc>

401,74,A1,"Manifesto of the Communist Party A spectre is haunting Europe – the spectre of communism . All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre : Pope and Tsar , Metternich and Guizot , French Radicals and German police-spies . Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power ? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism , against the more advanced opposition parties , as well as against its reactionary adversaries ? Two things result from this fact : I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power . II . It is high time that Communists should openly , in the face of the whole world , publish their views , their aims , their tendencies , and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself . To this end , Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto , to be published in the English , French , German , Italian , Flemish and Danish languages . I. Bourgeois and Proletarians * The history of all hitherto existing society † is the history of class struggles . Freeman and slave , patrician and plebeian , lord and serf , guild-master ‡ and journeyman , in a word , oppressor and oppressed , stood in constant opposition to one another , carried on an uninterrupted , now hidden , now open fight , a fight that each time ended , either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large , or in the common ruin of the contending classes . In the earlier epochs of history , we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders , a manifold gradation of social rank . In ancient Rome we have patricians , knights , plebeians , slaves ; in the Middle Ages , feudal lords , vassals , guild-masters , journeymen , apprentices , serfs ; in almost all of these classes , again , subordinate gradations . The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms . It has but established new classes , new conditions of oppression , new forms of struggle in place of the old ones . Our epoch , the epoch of the bourgeoisie , possesses , however , this distinct feature : it has simplified class antagonisms . Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps , into two great classes directly facing each other – Bourgeoisie and Proletariat . From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns . From these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed . The discovery of America , the rounding of the Cape , opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie . The East-Indian and Chinese markets , the colonisation of America , trade with the colonies , the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally , gave to commerce , to navigation , to industry , an impulse never before known , and thereby , to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society , a rapid development . The feudal system of industry , in which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds , now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets . The manufacturing system took its place . The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class ; division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop . Meantime the markets kept ever growing , the demand ever rising . Even manufacturer no longer sufficed . Thereupon , steam and machinery revolutionised industrial production . The place of manufacture was taken by the giant , Modern Industry ; the place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires , the leaders of the whole industrial armies , the modern bourgeois . Modern industry has established the world market , for which the discovery of America paved the way . This market has given an immense development to commerce , to navigation , to communication by land . This development has , in its turn , reacted on the extension of industry ; and in proportion as industry , commerce , navigation , railways extended , in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed , increased its capital , and pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages . We see , therefore , how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development , of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange . Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class . An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility , an armed and self-governing association in the medieval commune * : here independent urban republic ( as in Italy and Germany ) ; there taxable "" third estate "" of the monarchy ( as in France ) ; afterwards , in the period of manufacturing proper , serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility , and , in fact , cornerstone of the great monarchies in general , the bourgeoisie has at last , since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market , conquered for itself , in the modern representative State , exclusive political sway . The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie . The bourgeoisie , historically , has played a most revolutionary part . The bourgeoisie , wherever it has got the upper hand , has put an end to all feudal , patriarchal , idyllic relations . It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his "" natural superiors "" , and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest , than callous "" cash payment "" . It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour , of chivalrous enthusiasm , of philistine sentimentalism , in the icy water of egotistical calculation . It has resolved personal worth into exchange value , and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms , has set up that single , unconscionable freedom – Free Trade . In one word , for exploitation , veiled by religious and political illusions , it has substituted naked , shameless , direct , brutal exploitation . The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe . It has converted the physician , the lawyer , the priest , the poet , the man of science , into its paid wage labourers . The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil , and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation . The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages , which reactionaries so much admire , found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence . It has been the first to show what man's activity can bring about . It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids , Roman aqueducts , and Gothic cathedrals ; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former Exoduses of nations and crusades . The bourgeoisie can not exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production , and thereby the relations of production , and with them the whole relations of society . Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form , was , on the contrary , the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes . Constant revolutionising of production , uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions , everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones . All fixed , fast-frozen relations , with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions , are swept away , all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify . All that is solid melts into air , all that is holy is profaned , and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life , and his relations with his kind . The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe . It must nestle everywhere , settle everywhere , establish connexions everywhere . The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country . To the great chagrin of Reactionists , it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood . All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed . They are dislodged by new industries , whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations , by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material , but raw material drawn from the remotest zones ; industries whose products are consumed , not only at home , but in every quarter of the globe . In place of the old wants , satisfied by the production of the country , we find new wants , requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes . In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency , we have intercourse in every direction , universal inter-dependence of nations . And as in material , so also in intellectual production . The intellectual creations of individual nations become common property . National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible , and from the numerous national and local literatures , there arises a world literature . The bourgeoisie , by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production , by the immensely facilitated means of communication , draws all , even the most barbarian , nations into civilisation . The cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all Chinese walls , with which it forces the barbarians ' intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate . It compels all nations , on pain of extinction , to adopt the bourgeois mode of production ; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst , i . e . , to become bourgeois themselves . In one word , it creates a world after its own image . The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns . It has created enormous cities , has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural , and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life . Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns , so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones , nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois , the East on the West . The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population , of the means of production , and of property . It has agglomerated population , centralised the means of production , and has concentrated property in a few hands . The necessary consequence of this was political centralisation . Independent , or but loosely connected provinces , with separate interests , laws , governments , and systems of taxation , became lumped together into one nation , with one government , one code of laws , one national class-interest , one frontier , and one customs-tariff . The bourgeoisie , during its rule of scarce one hundred years , has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together . Subjection of Nature's forces to man , machinery , application of chemistry to industry and agriculture , steam-navigation , railways , electric telegraphs , clearing of whole continents for cultivation , canalisation of rivers , whole populations conjured out of the ground – what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour ? We see then : the means of production and of exchange , on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up , were generated in feudal society . At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange , the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged , the feudal organisation of agriculture and manufacturing industry , in one word , the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces ; they became so many fetters . They had to be burst asunder ; they were burst asunder . Into their place stepped free competition , accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it , and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class . A similar movement is going on before our own eyes . Modern bourgeois society , with its relations of production , of exchange and of property , a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange , is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells . For many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production , against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeois and of its rule . It is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire bourgeois society on its trial , each time more threateningly . In these crises , a great part not only of the existing products , but also of the previously created productive forces , are periodically destroyed . In these crises , there breaks out an epidemic that , in all earlier epochs , would have seemed an absurdity – the epidemic of over-production . Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism ; it appears as if a famine , a universal war of devastation , had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence ; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed ; and why ? Because there is too much civilisation , too much means of subsistence , too much industry , too much commerce . The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property ; on the contrary , they have become too powerful for these conditions , by which they are fettered , and so soon as they overcome these fetters , they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society , endanger the existence of bourgeois property . The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them . And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises ? On the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces ; on the other , by the conquest of new markets , and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones . That is to say , by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises , and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented . The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself . But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself ; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons – the modern working class – the proletarians . In proportion as the bourgeoisie , i . e . , capital , is developed , in the same proportion is the proletariat , the modern working class , developed – a class of labourers , who live only so long as they find work , and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital . These labourers , who must sell themselves piecemeal , are a commodity , like every other article of commerce , and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition , to all the fluctuations of the market . Owing to the extensive use of machinery , and to the division of labour , the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character , and , consequently , all charm for the workman . He becomes an appendage of the machine , and it is only the most simple , most monotonous , and most easily acquired knack , that is required of him . Hence , the cost of production of a workman is restricted , almost entirely , to the means of subsistence that he requires for maintenance , and for the propagation of his race . But the price of a commodity , and therefore also of labour , is equal to its cost of production . In proportion , therefore , as the repulsiveness of the work increases , the wage decreases . Nay more , in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases , in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases , whether by prolongation of the working hours , by the increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of machinery , etc. Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist . Masses of labourers , crowded into the factory , are organised like soldiers . As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants . Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class , and of the bourgeois State ; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine , by the overlooker , and , above all , by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself . The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim , the more petty , the more hateful and the more embittering it is . The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour , in other words , the more modern industry becomes developed , the more is the labour of men superseded by that of women . Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class . All are instruments of labour , more or less expensive to use , according to their age and sex . No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer , so far , at an end , that he receives his wages in cash , than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie , the landlord , the shopkeeper , the pawnbroker , etc. The lower strata of the middle class – the small tradespeople , shopkeepers , and retired tradesmen generally , the handicraftsmen and peasants – all these sink gradually into the proletariat , partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried on , and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists , partly because their specialised skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production . Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population . The proletariat goes through various stages of development . With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie . At first the contest is carried on by individual labourers , then by the workpeople of a factory , then by the operative of one trade , in one locality , against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them . They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production , but against the instruments of production themselves ; they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour , they smash to pieces machinery , they set factories ablaze , they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the Middle Ages . At this stage , the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country , and broken up by their mutual competition . If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies , this is not yet the consequence of their own active union , but of the union of the bourgeoisie , which class , in order to attain its own political ends , is compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion , and is moreover yet , for a time , able to do so . At this stage , therefore , the proletarians do not fight their enemies , but the enemies of their enemies , the remnants of absolute monarchy , the landowners , the non-industrial bourgeois , the petty bourgeois . Thus , the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie ; every victory so obtained is a victory for the bourgeoisie . But with the development of industry , the proletariat not only increases in number ; it becomes concentrated in greater masses , its strength grows , and it feels that strength more . The various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised , in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour , and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level . The growing competition among the bourgeois , and the resulting commercial crises , make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating . The increasing improvement of machinery , ever more rapidly developing , makes their livelihood more and more precarious ; the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions between two classes . Thereupon , the workers begin to form combinations ( Trades' Unions ) against the bourgeois ; they club together in order to keep up the rate of wages ; they found permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these occasional revolts . Here and there , the contest breaks out into riots . Now and then the workers are victorious , but only for a time . The real fruit of their battles lies , not in the immediate result , but in the ever expanding union of the workers . This union is helped on by the improved means of communication that are created by modern industry , and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another . It was just this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local struggles , all of the same character , into one national struggle between classes . But every class struggle is a political struggle . And that union , to attain which the burghers of the Middle Ages , with their miserable highways , required centuries , the modern proletarian , thanks to railways , achieve in a few years . This organisation of the proletarians into a class , and , consequently into a political party , is continually being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves . But it ever rises up again , stronger , firmer , mightier . It compels legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers , by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself . Thus , the ten-hours' bill in England was carried . Altogether collisions between the classes of the old society further , in many ways , the course of development of the proletariat . The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle . At first with the aristocracy ; later on , with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself , whose interests have become antagonistic to the progress of industry ; at all time with the bourgeoisie of foreign countries . In all these battles , it sees itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat , to ask for help , and thus , to drag it into the political arena . The bourgeoisie itself , therefore , supplies the proletariat with its own elements of political and general education , in other words , it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting the bourgeoisie . Further , as we have already seen , entire sections of the ruling class are , by the advance of industry , precipitated into the proletariat , or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence . These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress . Finally , in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour , the progress of dissolution going on within the ruling class , in fact within the whole range of old society , assumes such a violent , glaring character , that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift , and joins the revolutionary class , the class that holds the future in its hands . Just as , therefore , at an earlier period , a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie , so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat , and in particular , a portion of the bourgeois ideologists , who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole . Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today , the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class . The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry ; the proletariat is its special and essential product . The lower middle class , the small manufacturer , the shopkeeper , the artisan , the peasant , all these fight against the bourgeoisie , to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class . They are therefore not revolutionary , but conservative . Nay more , they are reactionary , for they try to roll back the wheel of history . If by chance , they are revolutionary , they are only so in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat ; they thus defend not their present , but their future interests , they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat . The "" dangerous class "" , [ lumpenproletariat ] the social scum , that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of the old society , may , here and there , be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution ; its conditions of life , however , prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue . In the condition of the proletariat , those of old society at large are already virtually swamped . The proletarian is without property ; his relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with the bourgeois family relations ; modern industry labour , modern subjection to capital , the same in England as in France , in America as in Germany , has stripped him of every trace of national character . Law , morality , religion , are to him so many bourgeois prejudices , behind which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois interests . All the preceding classes that got the upper hand sought to fortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their conditions of appropriation . The proletarians can not become masters of the productive forces of society , except by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation , and thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation . They have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify ; their mission is to destroy all previous securities for , and insurances of , individual property . All previous historical movements were movements of minorities , or in the interest of minorities . The proletarian movement is the self-conscious , independent movement of the immense majority , in the interest of the immense majority . The proletariat , the lowest stratum of our present society , can not stir , can not raise itself up , without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air . Though not in substance , yet in form , the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle . The proletariat of each country must , of course , first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie . In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat , we traced the more or less veiled civil war , raging within existing society , up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution , and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat . Hitherto , every form of society has been based , as we have already seen , on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes . But in order to oppress a class , certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can , at least , continue its slavish existence . The serf , in the period of serfdom , raised himself to membership in the commune , just as the petty bourgeois , under the yoke of the feudal absolutism , managed to develop into a bourgeois . The modern labourer , on the contrary , instead of rising with the process of industry , sinks deeper and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class . He becomes a pauper , and pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth . And here it becomes evident , that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society , and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an over-riding law . It is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery , because it can not help letting him sink into such a state , that it has to feed him , instead of being fed by him . Society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie , in other words , its existence is no longer compatible with society . The essential conditions for the existence and for the sway of the bourgeois class is the formation and augmentation of capital ; the condition for capital is wage-labour . Wage-labour rests exclusively on competition between the labourers . The advance of industry , whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie , replaces the isolation of the labourers , due to competition , by the revolutionary combination , due to association . The development of Modern Industry , therefore , cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products . What the bourgeoisie therefore produces , above all , are its own grave-diggers . Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable . </doc>

What the next mania will be , we do n't know . That it 's coming is as certain as day after night . Tom Raum , AP Writer , on Saturday March 22nd , reminds us that the Federal Reserve "" ... is the only U.S. institution with the authority and ability to create money out of this air . "" That this is in direct conflict with the U.S. Constitution , Article I Section 8 , which gives Congress – not that Federal Reserve – the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof , does not receive mention . But that 's just an aside . "" -- slashed a key short-term interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point , to 2.25 percent . The cut was sixth since September . "" These steps followed moves to lend $ 100 billion in cash to banks and $ 200 billion in Treasury bonds to cash-strapped investment banks . The goal was to keep the financial system from seizing up . "" With the credit contraction calling into question the solvency of banks ... and the Federal Reserve throwing massive amounts of money back into the banking sector to counter act the crunch , traders did n't know whether to laugh or cry . So they did both . Knowing When To Say When Maybe the crisis has been averted . Or maybe it 's been postponed . But regardless , this massive money infusion is unhealthy . If you remember back to 2002 , the Alan Greenspan led Federal Reserve artificially lowered the rate of interest below the rate of inflation to soften the landing of the dot com bust that they 'd helped inflate . All the sham money went into housing and produced a sham housing boom . The boom was really just a Federal Reserve induced asset inflation . But now that housing prices are deflating , and that much of the debt that supported the sham boom prices is going bad ... the Federal Reserve is at it again – desperately trying to pump the bubble back up . Where the money will go this time may not be as fun . So far it seems to be showing up in prices at the grocery store , the gas pumps , and in your utility bill . Regardless of where the money goes , these repeated cycles of reflation are grotesquely unhealthy . For example , following the holidays Joe gained 10-pounds . He went on a diet , but , unfortunately , he only lost 5 of those pounds . Still five extra pounds are no big deal , right ? But the next year , the same thing happened . Now Joe's 10-pounds over weight . And the following year it happened again ... and on and on . Until after several more years Joe has morphed into a rotund and unrecognizable version of his old self . Joe's knees now hurt and his chest pounds when he walks up stairs . And when he fly 's on an airplane his weight causes those around him to be uncomfortable – both because he bulges into their space and because they must look at him up close . Little kids gawk and stare . And little old ladies look the other way in repulsion . All because Joe did n't know when to say when to the extra servings of mashed potatoes . So goes the U.S. economy ... it 's had more than enough binges upon cheap credit . But the Federal Reserve wants to keep dishing up more . For in their mind the pain of eating more is less than the pain of diet and exercise . Will the inflation Ponzi scheme continue or will a long Japanese deflation take over ? If we had our druthers we 'd choose neither . But that choice no longer exists . And even if it did , it 's not up to us ; it 's up to the fate of the gods to decide . Sincerely , </doc>

1021,1440,A7,"THE BRUSH ATTACHMENT The brush attachment is positioned over the top of the large drum just after the space where the two drums are the closest . It 's placed where the fiber enters the carder and is the most efficient location . The function of the brush is to : Keep fiber from flying away ( as happens with angora ) Push the fiber down into the teeth of the large drum ( hence producing a fuller loftier batt ) Assist in the carding operation by firmly brushing the fiber after it has been initially carded by the counter rotating infeed and take up drums . It almost acts like a "" third drum "" . To obtain the above in the most efficient manner , the design of the actual brush ( including length and stiffness of the bristles ) , the support brackets and the position of the brush relative to the large drum are all important . These criteria are maximized in the Strauch drum carder thereby allowing the brush attachment on these carders to efficiently handle a variety of fibers . This properly designed brush works with fibers from very coarse to very fine and long to relatively short . Some folks have "" Rube Goldberged "" brushes using a paint brush , wallpaper brush or dog combing brush . While they may work with some fibers , they will not handle all the various ones used by fiber artists . The fabulous brush attachment is now standard on all series of drum carders . </doc>

1025,851,A1,"Charities – good or bad ? Seems strange , does n't it ? But a lot of charities say they would prefer not to exist – or rather that they would prefer not to have to exist . For example , if there had been no boys and girls living in poverty in 19th-century London , Dr Barnardo would not have needed to set up his children's homes . And , if there were no hunger or war in the world , there would be no need for charities like Oxfam or Comic Relief . So , charities are often best placed to provide help where there otherwise would n't be any . But not everybody thinks that highly of charities . What do you think about these three opinions ? </doc>

Today , the company controls the traffic on 500 commercial stretches of 165 Spanish cities . The vocation of service to their clients who are retail chains that combine location in streets and shopping centers , has led the company to expand its services measuring TC - Street in malls . According to Marta Fernandez , director of marketing for T - Cuento "" Malls are like neighborhoods , where we find streets with more and less traffic . As in the cities , retailers need to know the flow of people in their street at the mall to calculate how many potential customers walk by their property and know exactly the attractiveness of the location and its CPC , a new KPI for the retailer . "" The Cost per Potential Client ( CPC ) is the result of combining the number of people or potential customers walking by every month , with the cost of the rent . This data helps to compare and discover new profitable locations , to assist in expansion plans or even to negotiate the price of a commercial lease . TC - Street is measuring fifty shopping centers ( such as La Vaguada , La Maquinista , Plenilunio , Glories or Las Arenas ) . Before the end of the year , the company plans to triple the number , and offer access to data through their website , www.tc-street.com More about TC-Street </doc>

775,788,A14,"Title of Research Functional characterisation of AChE variants during osteo-chondrogenesis Summary of Research Arthritis and related diseases are ultimately the consequence of damage to cartilage and bone , which prevents these tissues from functioning normally , causing pain , immobility and disability . Pioneering work from our laboratroy has shown that a protein , AChE , is produced by cells within bone and cartilage and that AChE can regulate the functional properties of these cells . However , we have also shown that AChE can exist in several different forms in the skeleton , each with unique characteristics . In this project , we will determine how these individual AChE proteins regulate the formation and function of cartilage and bone in both normal and disease conditions . This may reveal new ways in which we can manipulate the formation of skeletal tissues for the treatment of bone and joint disease . </doc>

Asylum Bio-Comp implant This implant system is nearly identical to the juicer version with two major exceptions . The first difference is that the Asylum version can be implanted into any ' mundane ' race with very little modification .

When he gets his food the Bio-comp may say something like "" You are n't going to eat THAT , are you ? Do you have any idea how many carcinogens are in that ? "" or perhaps Bob is running for his life , and has not slept in 24 hours , the bio-comp will suggest that Bob should get some sleep and will even go so far as to suggest tranquilizers !

Note : it is the water that gets trapped in the filter while the ' impurities ' are allowed to pass through it . 4 . ) Glare Filter The Asylum will often offer this as part of a standard refit or upgrade . This filter is for optic systems and will allow the user to see only the glare , all parts of the image that are not glare will be filtered out . 5 . ) Asylum Silly Putty Two Geniuses at the Asylum were working on two separate projects ( one with nano-technology , the other with Changeling DNA ) , when a lab accident caused the two projects to come into contact with each other . The end result was the creation of ' Silly Putty ' This putty is independently intelligent and is sold in 12 oz. units . These little blobs , can understand the spoken word and are quite loyal to their owner / friend / master . No one understands quite what the putty is but , it is a lot of fun . The putty can understand and will follow simple commands like : "" Crawl under the door and open it from the inside . "" or "" Hide this ' bug ' in the room . "" The silly putty gets it 's name from it tendency to laugh maniacally for no apparent reason . Note : it is impossible for two or more silly putties to be combined into one larger putty , as each has an independent personality and will resist the union . </doc>

91,22,A1,"The End of the Russia-China Debate Ten years ago , comparing the reform processes in China and Russia was an intellectual fashion . Was it preferable to start with economics – try and get rich , quick , but do n't rock the boat politically – in the manner of the Chinese ? Or was it better to start with politics – recover liberty and prosperity may follow – which seemed to be Russia's path under Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin ? Today , a new comparative debate has started . This time the subject is no longer Russia versus China , because Russia has long ceased to be a point of comparison . Instead , the new comparative debate involves Asia's two new economic , demographic , and political giants , China and India . China's annual economic growth has been roughly 8-9 % for the last 26 years ; India has recorded similar rates for the last decade . In the "" flat world "" of globalization – to borrow Thomas Friedman's powerful metaphor – it seems that Russia no longer has a place . Of course , Russia is still the second-largest nuclear power in the world , and , as one of the world's leading exporters of oil and gas , it benefits from today's high energy prices . But Russia's population is disappearing before our eyes . With average male life expectancy just 57 years , the country is losing close to 800,000 people annually . Indeed , Russia is more a fragile oil-producing state than a modernizing economic giant . To put it bluntly , Russia is no longer in the same category as China . Whereas the "" Middle Kingdom "" is proudly regaining its former global status after centuries of decline , Russia is defiantly trying to resurrect its former imperial status , but in a manner that appears doomed to fail . Russia has clearly taken giant steps in the wrong direction , at a time when China has taken steps , however small , in the right direction . When you meet today's "" new Russian Nomenklatura , "" you experience a sudden feeling of being 20 years younger , awash as they are in nostalgia for Cold War posturing . By contrast , seen from afar , in their new suits , you might think that Chinese economic elites are Japanese . Where Russia represents a return to the past , one sees in China an opening , however ambiguous , to the future . Of course , some bias is involved here . As a European , I and people like me almost instinctively expect more from Russia . It is , after all , a European nation in cultural , if not political terms , whereas progress in China will not be measured by the introduction of Western-style democracy , but eventually , one hopes , by Singapore-style rule of law . The diverse paths followed by Russia and China may be explained in part by how the two peoples perceive themselves . The Chinese are comforted in their self-image by the world's combination of admiration for their dynamism , greed for the market they constitute , and apprehension for the competition they represent . Russians , by contrast , seem to be animated by a dark form of narcissism . They do not find anything to be proud of in the eyes of others . They are respected for what they control – the Soviet legacy of nuclear arms and "" Christian energy resources , "" to quote Vladimir Putin's bizarre remark on his first official trip to Paris – but not for their economic performance or their essence . China and Russia tend to relate to their respective pasts and futures in very different ways – with self-confidence in China's case , with self-diffidence in the case of Russia . Chinese elites are convinced that time is working in their favor , and that it is only natural that China should regain its rank amongst the world leading powers , perhaps even emerging on top one day . Indeed , their serene patience stands in stark contrast to the anxious reticence of Russian leaders , who have yet to surmount the humiliation that Russia suffered as a result of the Soviet Union's disintegration at the end of the Cold War . Russia may be experiencing a global "" restoration "" phase , but in politics and economics , and also with respect to its empire , restoration is headed in the wrong direction . With Putin's current clampdown on civil society , re-nationalization of key segments of the economy , failure to develop any political approach to resolving the conflict in Chechnya , and cultivation of imperial nostalgia , Russia is killing its only chance to matter in the future . Yet there is no reason for China to declare victory . The gap between the respective qualities of China's economic and scientific elites , on the one hand , and its ruling political elites , on the other , is simply too monumental – and still growing – for stability to be taken for granted . One senses in China the birth pangs of civil society , making the introduction of the rule of law increasingly urgent . Without political reforms , China's confidence in herself will quickly turn into disillusion , or even delusion . If that happens , the Russia-China debate might be revived , this time as a comparison of competitive decadence . </doc>

States Parties undertake to include such offences as extraditable offences in every extradition treaty to be subsequently concluded between them . When a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty , the requested State Party may , at its option , consider this Convention as a legal basis for extradition in respect of the offences set forth in article 2 . Extradition shall be subject to the other conditions provided by the law of the requested State . States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize the offences set forth in article 2 as extraditable offences between themselves , subject to the conditions provided by the law of the requested State . If necessary , the offences set forth in article 2 shall be treated , for the purposes of extradition between States Parties , as if they had been committed not only in the place in which they occurred but also in the territory of the States that have established jurisdiction in accordance with article 9 , paragraphs 1 and 2 . The provisions of all extradition treaties and arrangements between States Parties with regard to offences set forth in article 2 shall be deemed to be modified as between States Parties to the extent that they are incompatible with this Convention . Article 14 States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with investigations or criminal or extradition proceedings brought in respect of the offences set forth in article 2 , including assistance in obtaining evidence at their disposal necessary for the proceedings . States Parties shall carry out their obligations under paragraph 1 of the present article in conformity with any treaties or other arrangements on mutual legal assistance that may exist between them . In the absence of such treaties or arrangements , States Parties shall afford one another assistance in accordance with their national law . Article 15 None of the offences set forth in article 2 shall be regarded , for the purposes of extradition or mutual legal assistance , as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political offence or as an offence inspired by political motives . Accordingly , a request for extradition or for mutual legal assistance based on such an offence may not be refused on the sole ground that it concerns a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by political motives . Article 16 Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite or to afford mutual legal assistance if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for offences set forth in article 2 or for mutual legal assistance with respect to such offences has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person's race , religion , nationality , ethnic origin or political opinion or that compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that person's position for any of these reasons . Article 17 A person who is being detained or is serving a sentence in the territory of one State Party whose presence in another State Party is requested for purposes of testimony , identification or otherwise providing assistance in obtaining evidence for the investigation or prosecution of offences under this Convention may be transferred if the following conditions are met : ( a ) The person freely gives his or her informed consent ; and ( b ) The competent authorities of both States agree , subject to such conditions as those States may deem appropriate . For the purposes of the present article : ( a ) The State to which the person is transferred shall have the authority and obligation to keep the person transferred in custody , unless otherwise requested or authorized by the State from which the person was transferred ; ( b ) The State to which the person is transferred shall without delay implement its obligation to return the person to the custody of the State from which the person was transferred as agreed beforehand , or as otherwise agreed , by the competent authorities of both States ; ( c ) The State to which the person is transferred shall not require the State from which the person was transferred to initiate extradition proceedings for the return of the person ; ( d ) The person transferred shall receive credit for service of the sentence being served in the State from which he was transferred for time spent in the custody of the State to which he was transferred . Unless the State Party from which a person is to be transferred in accordance with the present article so agrees , that person , whatever his or her nationality , shall not be prosecuted or detained or subjected to any other restriction of his or her personal liberty in the territory of the State to which that person is transferred in respect of acts or convictions anterior to his or her departure from the territory of the State from which such person was transferred . Article 18 Upon seizing or otherwise taking control of radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities , following the commission of an offence set forth in article 2 , the State Party in possession of it shall : ( a ) Take steps to render harmless the radioactive material , device or nuclear facility ; ( b ) Ensure that any nuclear material is held in accordance with applicable International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards ; and ( c ) Have regard to physical protection recommendations and health and safety standards published by the International Atomic Energy Agency . Upon the completion of any proceedings connected with an offence set forth in article 2 , or sooner if required by international law , any radioactive material , device or nuclear facility shall be returned , after consultations ( in particular , regarding modalities of return and storage ) with the States Parties concerned to the State Party to which it belongs , to the State Party of which the natural or legal person owning such radioactive material , device or facility is a national or resident , or to the State Party from whose territory it was stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained . 3 ( 1 ) Where a State Party is prohibited by national or international law from returning or accepting such radioactive material , device or nuclear facility or where the States Parties concerned so agree , subject to paragraph 3 ( 2 ) of the present article , the State Party in possession of the radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities shall continue to take the steps described in paragraph 1 of the present article ; such radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities shall be used only for peaceful purposes . 3 ( 2 ) Where it is not lawful for the State Party in possession of the radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities to possess them , that State shall ensure that they are as soon as possible placed in the possession of a State for which such possession is lawful and which , where appropriate , has provided assurances consistent with the requirements of paragraph 1 of the present article in consultation with that State , for the purpose of rendering it harmless ; such radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities shall be used only for peaceful purposes . If the radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the present article do not belong to any of the States Parties or to a national or resident of a State Party or was not stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained from the territory of a State Party , or if no State is willing to receive such item pursuant to paragraph 3 of the present article , a separate decision concerning its disposition shall , subject to paragraph 3 ( 2 ) of the present article , be taken after consultations between the States concerned and any relevant international organizations . For the purposes of paragraphs 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 of the present article , the State Party in possession of the radioactive material , device or nuclear facility may request the assistance and cooperation of other States Parties , in particular the States Parties concerned , and any relevant international organizations , in particular the International Atomic Energy Agency . States Parties and the relevant international organizations are encouraged to provide assistance pursuant to this paragraph to the maximum extent possible . The States Parties involved in the disposition or retention of the radioactive material , device or nuclear facility pursuant to the present article shall inform the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency of the manner in which such an item was disposed of or retained . The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency shall transmit the information to the other States Parties . In the event of any dissemination in connection with an offence set forth in article 2 , nothing in the present article shall affect in any way the rules of international law governing liability for nuclear damage , or other rules of international law . Article 19 The State Party where the alleged offender is prosecuted shall , in accordance with its national law or applicable procedures , communicate the final outcome of the proceedings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations , who shall transmit the information to the other States Parties . Article 20 States Parties shall conduct consultations with one another directly or through the Secretary-General of the United Nations , with the assistance of international organizations as necessary , to ensure effective implementation of this Convention . Article 21 The States Parties shall carry out their obligations under this Convention in a manner consistent with the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and that of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States . Article 22 Nothing in this Convention entitles a State Party to undertake in the territory of another State Party the exercise of jurisdiction and performance of functions which are exclusively reserved for the authorities of that other State Party by its national law . Article 23 Any dispute between two or more States Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Convention which can not be settled through negotiation within a reasonable time shall , at the request of one of them , be submitted to arbitration .

564,1145,A17,"Tara Browne : the James Dean of Sixties London who inspired The Beatles Keiron Pim reviews a biography of the Guinness heir whose early death in a sports car crash inspired the Beatles' A Day in the Life I n Swinging London , most figures of significance inhabited one circle – art , pop , criminality or aristocracy – but intersected with others . Tara Browne was no exception . He was of the seventh generation of the Guinness brewing family : in the snobbish parlance of the upper classes , they were "" trade "" ; and in the playwright Brendan Behan's wry description , "" the only English aristocrats who have remained truly Irish "" . As an heir to the family fortune Browne had vast wealth but also a nagging doubt that his friends were attracted to him for any other reason . In one of the more memorable quotations to come from his mouth in Paul Howard 's I Heard the News Today , Oh Boy , the first full-length biography , Browne describes himself as "" a hustlee "" , but one who was content to be hustled if it helped accelerate the capital's whirl in the mid-Sixties . Tara Browne's specially painted AC Cobra on display in 1967 Credit : Martin Cook S ince that overfamiliar moment has been chronicled ad nauseam , Howard's tactic – to find a new slant on it through a minor character who influenced more famous friends – is astute . Browne's sole line in the history books to date has to do with the opening verse of the Beatles' A Day in the Life , written after he died in a car crash in Chelsea in December 1966 . He was 21 years old . John Lennon , distanced into cosmic ambivalence by a vast intake of hallucinogens , sang that "" the news was rather sad "" but he "" just had to laugh "" . Browne was closer to Paul McCartney , whom he turned on to LSD at his home in Eaton Row and introduced to his aristocratic fraternity : Julian Ormsby Gore , Sir Mark Palmer , Nicholas Gormanston . McCartney , like the Rolling Stones' Brian Jones , found he could relax in their company , without fear that they had ulterior motives for befriending him . Browne "" was like a young prince really "" , the designer Michael Rainey tells Howard , so McCartney "" saw him as a complete equal "" . F ew people who die so young merit a 300-page biography , but Howard's treatment is saved from sluggishness by his precocious subject's tendency to live at a speed befitting his great talent , which was for motor-racing . Browne's mother , Oonagh , was a bohemian society beauty and his childhood had few boundaries . He acquired her vocabulary : as a boy he called his elderly nursemaid "" a silly old c --- "" . At 11 he announced that he was giving up cigarettes and alcohol . By adolescence he was an "" extraordinary little character who looked like a boy but talked like a man ' "" . His proposed education at Eton held no appeal ; at 13 he was traversing Ireland field-recording traditional music for his brother Garech's nascent record label . Spells in Venice , New York and Paris followed , during which his tutors found him charming , literate but unteachable . At 18 he married Nicki Rogers , the beautiful ( but in his mother's eyes quite unsuitable ) daughter of an Irish farmer , and soon they had two sons . Young Tara in 1958 Credit : ANL / REX / Shutterstock I n the book's first half , Browne pales beside the adults around him at the family home , Luggala in County Wicklow . Oonagh was a mischievous hostess whose dinner guests were combined to provoke . Her ludicrous con man-cum-fashion-designer third husband , Miguel Ferreras , squandered Guinness money on his couturier ambitions and a succession of crashed sports cars , when he was n't prowling the night in search of a new boyfriend . In the second half , Browne assumes prominence as he steps into a vividly depicted mid-Sixties London . Howard is deft in sketching the many political and economic factors that set the city swinging and equally good on this social upheaval's liberating effects . The wave of working-class teenagers who came to art school in the early Sixties brings us to the Yorkshire-born painter Dudley Edwards , whose memories of Pakistani families ' "" magical "" multicoloured doorways in Bradford inspired his psychedelic designs , later to adorn McCartney's piano and the interior of Dandie Fashions , a boutique opened in 1966 and financially backed by Browne . Nicki in Ireland in 1966 with Brian Jones , Anita Pallenberg and others on the way to Browne's 21st birthday party Credit : Michael Cooper collection A t the decade's apex the elfin , velvet-clad Browne seems to have been everywhere : consorting nightly with Brian Jones at the Scotch of St James , racing sports cars ( both around London and in competition ) , dining in Paris with Dalí , posing for Gentlemen's Quarterly alongside fellow dandies such as Christopher Gibbs , but also spending his days "" in garage overalls "" when most of his peers were "" in lace and satin "" . At his friend Len Street's garage , he tinkered engines for crooks who wanted getaway cars that could run at 120mph until they conked out , sufficiently far from the scene . Soon Browne was under strain from all directions . By late 1966 he was embroiled in a divorce suit . His two sons were in Oonagh's custody back in Ireland . He and Jones had locked together into a morbid psychological downward spiral in which both suspected , rightly , their time would soon be up . Their friend Martin Wilkinson visited Jones's "" gloomy "" flat in Courtfield Road and found him and Browne drawing Tibetan Buddhist mandalas that were intended to symbolise their entire lives , which seemed "" incredibly sinister ... because they were both so young , I remember thinking , how could you think your life is encapsulated in something like that ? "" H oward's prose is brisk , his research impressive . You sense there were delicate family politics to negotiate ; he takes pains to balance the perspectives of Nicki and Oonagh , who loathed one another . But an apparent dearth of letters or other documents means Browne is rarely quoted at length : we have little sense of his voice . Numerous interviewees assure us he was kind and sweet-natured , but more evidence of it would have fleshed out his character . At the book's close , though , there is a profound example . Just before Browne crashed his Lotus Elan into a van parked in Redcliffe Gardens , he swerved so that he took the impact rather than his girlfriend , Suki Potier . The next day a dark cloud settled over the city's jeunesse dorée . "" It was like a death knell sounding over London , "" recalls Marianne Faithfull , and "" the end of the Sixties for many people . "" Browne's story has certainly been romanticised . "" He knew his time would n't be long , "" says Nicki . "" He often said it . "" Nothing uncanny about that when one's hobby is driving through central London at 100 mph . As a biography , Howard's book is hindered by its subject's insubstantiality . But as a richly populated history traced along this spirited character's journey from Ireland to Swinging London , it is a fascinating piece of work . </doc>

776,1647,A16,"Great Famine , also called Irish Potato Famine , Great Irish Famine , or Famine of 1845 – 49 , famine that occurred in Ireland in 1845 – 49 when the potato crop failed in successive years . The crop failures were caused by late blight , a disease that destroys both the leaves and the edible roots , or tubers , of the potato plant . The causative agent of late blight is the water mold Phytophthora infestans . The Irish famine was the worst to occur in Europe in the 19th century . Famine ( 1997 ) , commemorating the Great Famine , sculpture by Rowan ... In the early 19th century , Ireland's tenant farmers as a class , especially in the west of Ireland , struggled both to provide for themselves and to supply the British market with cereal crops . Many farmers had long existed at virtually the subsistence level , given the small size of their allotments and the various hardships that the land presented for farming in some regions . The potato , which had become a staple crop in Ireland by the 18th century , was appealing in that it was a hardy , nutritious , and calorie-dense crop and relatively easy to grow in the Irish soil . By the early 1840s almost half the Irish population – but primarily the rural poor – had come to depend almost exclusively on the potato for their diet . The rest of the population also consumed it in large quantities . A heavy reliance on just one or two high-yielding types of potato greatly reduced the genetic variety that ordinarily prevents the decimation of an entire crop by disease , and thus the Irish became vulnerable to famine . In 1845 a strain of Phytophthora arrived accidentally from North America , and that same year Ireland had unusually cool moist weather , in which the blight thrived . Much of that year's potato crop rotted in the fields . That partial crop failure was followed by more-devastating failures in 1846 – 49 , as each year's potato crop was almost completely ruined by the blight . Starving Irish people raiding a government potato store ; wood engraving from the ... The British government's efforts to relieve the famine were inadequate . Although Conservative Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel continued to allow the export of grain from Ireland to Great Britain , he did what he could to provide relief in 1845 and early 1846 . He authorized the import of corn ( maize ) from the United States , which helped avert some starvation . Under the Liberal ( Whig ) cabinet of Lord John Russell , which assumed power in June 1846 , the emphasis shifted to reliance on Irish resources and the free market , which made disaster inevitable . An overview of the Great Famine in Ireland . Much of the financial burden of providing for the starving Irish peasantry was thrown upon the Irish landowners themselves ( through local poor relief ) and British absentee landowners . Because the peasantry was unable to pay its rents , however , the landlords soon ran out of funds with which to support them , and the result was that hundreds of thousands of Irish tenant farmers and labourers were evicted during the years of the crisis . Under the terms of the harsh 1834 British Poor Law , enacted in 1838 in Ireland , the "" able-bodied "" indigent were sent to workhouses rather than being given famine relief per se . British assistance was limited to loans , helping to fund soup kitchens , and providing employment on road building and other public works . The Irish disliked the imported cornmeal , and reliance on it led to nutritional deficiencies . Despite those shortcomings , by August 1847 as many as three million people were receiving rations at soup kitchens . All in all , the British government spent about £ 8 million on relief , and some private relief funds were raised as well . The impoverished Irish peasantry , lacking the money to purchase the foods their farms produced , continued throughout the famine to export grain , meat , and other high-quality foods to Britain . The government's grudging and ineffective measures to relieve the famine's distress intensified the resentment of British rule among the Irish people . Similarly damaging was the attitude among many British intellectuals that the crisis was a predictable and not-unwelcome corrective to high birth rates in the preceding decades and perceived flaws , in their opinion , in the Irish national character . The famine proved to be a watershed in the demographic history of Ireland . As a direct consequence of the famine , Ireland's population of almost 8.4 million in 1844 had fallen to 6.6 million by 1851 . The number of agricultural labourers and smallholders in the western and southwestern counties underwent an especially drastic decline . A further aftereffect of the famine was thus the clearing of many smallholders from the land and the concentration of landownership in fewer hands . Thereafter , more land than before was used for grazing sheep and cattle , providing animal foods for export to Britain . Victims of the Irish Potato Famine arriving in Liverpool , Eng . ; illustration in the ... About one million people died from starvation or from typhus and other famine-related diseases . The number of Irish who emigrated during the famine may have reached two million . Ireland's population continued to decline in the following decades because of overseas emigration and lower birth rates . By the time Ireland achieved independence in 1921 , its population was barely half of what it had been in the early 1840s . Victims of Ireland's Great Famine ( 1845 – 49 ) immigrating to North America by ship ; wood ... Britannica Web sites The worst famine to occur in Europe in the 19th century was the Irish Potato Famine , which resulted in the deaths of about one million people . The famine is also called the Great Potato Famine or the Great Irish Famine . The potato was the staple food of Ireland at the time , with most of the population relying on it for much of their diet . Poor people who lived in rural areas tended to eat potatoes almost exclusively . From 1845 to 1849 a plant disease caused the potato crops in Ireland to fail , year after year . Without potatoes to eat , the people went hungry . </doc>

This was a locket formed from magic of the great light her grandmother spoke of . She put it on and felt a strange feeling in her heart .

She saw bright blue sea above her and many many fish ... she saw things we 've only dreamed of seeing .

13,711,A1,"Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon has taken Britain one more step down the road to actually using nuclear weapons . To date it has been the unique role of the United States to have actually used nuclear we weapons – twice in Japan in 1945 . Now Mr Hoon has made it clear that it would be legitimate for Britain to agree first use of nuclear weapons – even against a non-nuclear weapons state . This statement comes in spite of Britain's support for the so-called ' negative security assurances ' of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to which Britain is a signatory , in which Britain promises not to attack non-nuclear weapons states with nuclear weapons . This is an appalling step in the Labour government 's increasingly bellicose approach to world affairs , and smacks of the Conservative policies of 1993 – when Malcolm Rifkind talked of the possible ' sub-strategic use of nuclear weapons ' and the dangers of ' rogue states ' . At that time the policy was based on the perceived need to create a new paradigm to justify the retention of nuclear weapons after the end of the Cold War . Now the government's position is designed to support the US President's war drive – most immediately against Iraq , but also threatening the other countries on Bush's nuclear hit-list . It is also presumably the government's desire to back the US that has led to Foreign Secretary Jack Straw's enunciation of a ' new era ' for British foreign policy . This will constitute an ' active and engaged global foreign policy ' , working with its allies to push back the ' boundaries of chaos ' . Presumably this means attacking Iraq in the face of opposition from the Arab states , Russia , China , the Iraqi opposition , countless countries from around the world , the majority of public opinion in Britain – the list is endless . It is more likely that such a policy will overturn the delicate regional balance that prevails and result in enormous suffering and destruction . Mr Straw should be reminded that in spite of the supposedly overwhelming success of the attack on Afghanistan , the war there is still not concluded and we are sending in more troops than ever . Not only that , Osama Bin Laden has not yet been brought to justice – although that war aim is increasingly swept under the carpet . Our political leaders may wish to pass swiftly onto the next conflict without a backward glance , but that is just not possible for the countless Afghani civilians whose lives have been blighted by the air-attacks , and who continue to be imperilled by the thousands of unexploded cluster bomblets . Our government must turn back from the path to war . It must reject the first use of nuclear weapons . It must raise the nuclear threshold , not lower it . The ' boundaries of chaos ' can only be pushed back by the assertion of order – through the application of , and respect for , international law and compliance with treaty commitments . That is the message that Mr Blair must take to the United States . </doc>

600,1457,A8,"Artist impression of the Deep Impact flyby spacecraft releasing its impactor towards comet Tempel-1 in July 2005 . The flyby spacecraft has been re-christened EPOXI and will begin its new assignment to hunt for super-Earth exoplanets . Image : NASA . EPOXI is a combination of two separate science investigations , one consisting of the Extrasolar Planet Observations and Characterisation ( EPOCh ) and the other of the flyby of comet Hartley-2 , planned for 2010 , called the Deep Impact eXtended Investigation ( DIXI ) , which follows in the footsteps of the hugely successful Deep Impact mission in July 2005 which revealed in unprecedented detail the surface of a comet and the effects of impact into such a finely powdered surface . For the majority of May , EPOXI was trained on the red dwarf star GJ436 , 32 light years from Earth . This star has a Neptune sized planet circling it every 20 to 30 days in an unusually eccentric orbit . "" Tidal forces from the star should have made the orbit circular , unless there is another planet whose gravitational tug pulls the orbit into an oval shape , "" says Drake Deming , EPOXI's Deputy Principal Investigator . "" If that second planet lies in the same orbital plane as the Neptune-sized planet then we should see it transit . The transit would be too shallow to be spotted by ground-based telescopes , and EPOXI is the only space mission that can look at GJ436 nearly continuously for several weeks . "" Deming and his team are in the process of analysing the results of these data . In addition to targeting the red dwarf star , EPOXI imaged the Earth over three 24-hour periods , measuring its rotational light curve at visible wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared . These observations will help to calibrate future observations of Earthlike exoplanets . EPOXI obtained a particularly interesting view of the Earth on May 29 , when the Moon passed in front of the Earth as viewed from the spacecraft . Transit events such as this will help planetary scientists to deduce the nature and composition of exoplanetary systems . Deep Impact captured this beautiful image of the impact into Comet Tempel-1 three summers ago . Dust and gas streaming from the point of impact is lit up in the impact flash . Image : NASA . </doc>

( 3 ) In the case of all the shares of the company , or of all those of its shares which are comprised in a portion of the share capital which satisfies the condition in paragraph ( 2 ) -- ( a ) each share must be paid up at least as to one-quarter of the nominal value of that share and the whole of any premium on it ; ( b ) where any of the shares in question or any premium payable on them has been fully or partly paid up by an undertaking given by any person that he or another should do work or perform services for the company or another , the undertaking must have been performed or otherwise discharged ; and ( c ) where any of the shares in question has been allotted as fully or partly paid up as to its nominal value or any premium payable on it otherwise than in cash , and the consideration for the allotment consists of or includes an undertaking ( other than one to which sub-paragraph ( b ) applies ) to the company , then either -- ( i ) that undertaking must have been either performed or otherwise discharged , or ( ii ) there must be a contract between the company and some person pursuant to which the undertaking is to be performed within 5 years from the time of the resolution . Old public company becoming private 6 . -- ( 1 ) An old public company may pass a special resolution not to be re-registered under Article 4 as a public company ; and Article 64 of the principal Order ( litigated objection by shareholders ) applies to the resolution as it would apply to a special resolution by a public company to be re-registered as private . ( 2 ) If either -- ( a ) 28 days from the passing of the resolution elapse without an application being made under Article 64 of the principal Order ( as applied ) , or ( b ) such an application is made and proceedings are concluded on the application without the court making an order for the cancellation of the resolution , the registrar shall issue the company with a certificate stating that it is a private company ; and the company then becomes a private company by virtue of the issue of the certificate . ( 3 ) For the purposes of paragraph ( 2 ) ( b ) , proceedings on the application are concluded -- ( a ) except in a case within sub-paragraph ( b ) , when the period mentioned in Article 64 ( 7 ) of the principal Order ( as applied ) for delivering an office copy of the court's order under that Article to the registrar has expired , or ( b ) when the company has been notified that the application has been withdrawn . ( 4 ) If an old public company delivers to the registrar a statutory declaration in the prescribed form by a director or secretary of the company that the company does not at the time of the declaration satisfy the conditions specified in Article 5 for the company to be re-registered as public , the registrar shall issue the company with a certificate stating that it is a private company ; and the company then becomes a private company by virtue of the issue of the certificate . ( 5 ) A certificate issued to a company under paragraph ( 2 ) or ( 4 ) is conclusive evidence that the requirements of that paragraph have been complied with and that the company is a private company . Failure by old public company to obtain new classification 7 . -- ( 1 ) If at any time a company which is an old public company has not delivered to the registrar a declaration under Article 6 ( 4 ) , the company and any officer of it who is in default is guilty of an offence unless at that time the company -- ( a ) has applied to be re-registered under Article 4 , and the application has not been refused or withdrawn , or ( b ) has passed a special resolution not to be re-registered under that Article , and the resolution has not been revoked , and has not been cancelled under Article 64 of the principal Order as applied by Article 6 of this Order . ( 2 ) A person guilty of an offence under paragraph ( 1 ) is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one-fifth of the statutory maximum or , on conviction after continued contravention , to a daily default fine not exceeding one-fiftieth of the statutory maximum for every day on which that paragraph is contravened . Shares of old public company held by itself ; charges on own shares 8 . -- ( 1 ) The following has effect notwithstanding Article 3 ( 2 ) . ( 2 ) References to a public company in Articles 156 to 159 of the principal Order ( treatment of a company's shares when acquired by itself ) do not include an old public company ; and references in those Articles to a private company are to be read accordingly . ( 3 ) In the case of a company which after 30th September 1984 remained an old public company and did not on or before that date apply to be re-registered under Article 10 of the Order of 1981 as a public company , any charge on its own shares which was in existence on or immediately before that date is a permitted charge for the purposes of Chapter V of Part VI of the principal Order and accordingly not void under Article 160 of that Order . Offers of shares and debentures by old public company 9 . Article 91 of the principal Order applies to an old public company as if it were a private company such as is mentioned in paragraph ( 1 ) of that Article . Trading under misleading name 10 . -- ( 1 ) An old public company is guilty of an offence if it carries on any trade , profession or business under a name which includes , as its last part , the words "" public limited company "" or any contraction or imitation of those words . ( 2 ) During the 3 years following the re-registration of an old public company under Article 10 of the Order of 1981 , Article 356 ( 1 ) of the principal Order and any other statutory provision requiring or authorising the name of the company to be shown on any document or other object , apply as if any reference in that provision to the name of the company were a reference to a name which either is its name or was its name before re-registration . ( 3 ) A company guilty of an offence under paragraph ( 1 ) , and any officer of the company who is in default , is liable on summary conviction as for an offence under Article 43 of the principal Order . Payment for share capital 11 . -- ( 1 ) Subject to paragraph ( 2 ) , Articles 109 , 111 to 113 , 116 , 118 and 120 to 125 of the principal Order apply to a company whose directors have passed and not revoked a resolution to be re-registered under Article 4 of this Order , as those Articles apply to a public company . ( 2 ) Articles 109 , 111 to 113 , 118 and 122 of the principal Order do not apply to the allotment of shares by a company , other than a public company registered as such on its original incorporation , where the contract for the allotment was entered into -- ( a ) except in a case falling within sub-paragraph ( b ) , on or before 31st December 1984 ; ( b ) in the case of a company re-registered or registered as a public company in pursuance of -- ( i ) a resolution to be re-registered under Article 53 of the principal Order , ( ii ) a resolution to be re-registered under Article r of this Order , or ( iii ) a resolution by a joint stock company that the company be a public company , being a resolution that was passed on or before 31st December 1984 , before the date on which the resolution was passed . Miscellaneous savings Pre-1901 companies limited by guarantee 12 . Article 26 of the principal Order does not apply in the case of companies registered before 1st January 1901 . Company official seal 13 . -- ( 1 ) A company which was incorporated before 1st January 1982 and which has such an official seal as is mentioned in Article 50 of the principal Order may use the seal for sealing such securities and documents as are there mentioned , notwithstanding anything in any instrument constituting or regulating the company or in any instrument made before that date which relates to any securities issued by the company . ( 2 ) Any provision of such an instrument which requires any such securities or documents to be signed shall not apply to the securities or documents if they are sealed with that seal . Share premiums : retrospective relief 14 . -- ( 1 ) The relief given by this Article ( being a re-enactment of Article 40 of the Order of 1982 ) applies only where a company has issued shares in circumstances to which this Article applies before 4th February 1981 . ( 2 ) Subject as follows , this Article applies where the issuing company ( that is , the company issuing shares as mentioned in Article 140 of the principal Order ) has issued at a premium shares which were allotted in pursuance of any arrangement providing for the allotment of shares in the issuing company on terms that the consideration for the shares allotted was to be provided by the issue or transfer to the issuing company of shares in another company or by the cancellation of any shares in that other company not held by the issuing company . ( 3 ) The other company in question must either have been at the time of the arrangement a subsidiary of the issuing company or of any company which was then the issuing company's holding company or have become such a subsidiary on the acquisition or cancellation of its shares in pursuance of the arrangement . ( 4 ) Any part of the premiums on the shares so issued which was not transferred to the company's share premium account in accordance with section 56 of the Act of 1960 shall be treated as if that section had never applied to those premiums ( and may accordingly be disregarded in determining the sum to be included in the company's share premium account ) . ( 5 ) Article 143 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of the principal Order applies for the interpretation of this Article ; and for the purposes of this Article -- ( a ) "" company "" ( except in references to the issuing company ) includes any body corporate , and ( b ) the definition of "" arrangement "" in Article 141 ( 7 ) of the principal Order applies . ( 6 ) This Article is deemed included in Chapter III of Part VI of the principal Order for the purpose of the Department's power under Article 144 of that Order to make regulations in respect of relief from the requirements of Article 140 of that Order . Saving , in case of re-issued debentures , of rights of certain mortgagees 15 . Whereas by section 104 of the M6 Companies ( Consolidation ) Act 1908 it was provided that , upon the re-issue of redeemed debentures , the person entitled to the debentures should have the same rights and priorities as if the debentures had not previously been issued : And whereas section 49 of the M7 Companies Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1930 amended section 104 of the Act of 1908 so as to provide ( among other things ) that the said person should have the same priorities as if the debentures had never been redeemed , but saved , in the case of debentures redeemed before , but re-issued after , 1st January 1933 , the rights and priorities of persons under mortgages and charges created before that date : Now , therefore , where any debentures which were redeemed before the date last mentioned have been re-issued after that date and before the commencement of the Act of 1960 ( 1st April 1961 ) , or are or have been re-issued after that commencement , the re-issue of the debentures does not prejudice , and is deemed never to have prejudiced , any right or priority which any person would have had under or by virtue of any such mortgage or charge as above referred to if section 104 of the Act of 1908 , as originally enacted , had been enacted in the Act of 1960 instead of section 89 of that Act , and in the principal Order instead of Article 203 of that Order . Removal of directors appointed for life 16 . Article 311 ( 1 ) of the principal Order does not , in the case of a private company , authorise the removal of a director holding office for life on 31st July 1979 , whether or not subject to retirement under an age limit by virtue of the company's articles or otherwise . Tax-free payments to directors 17 . Paragraph ( 1 ) of Article 319 of the principal Order does not apply to remuneration under a contract which was in force on 27th October 1959 and provides expressly ( and not by reference to the company's articles ) for payment of remuneration as mentioned in that paragraph ; and paragraph ( 2 ) of that Article does not apply to any provision contained in such a contract . Statutory declaration of solvency in voluntary winding up 18 . In relation to a winding up commenced before 1st July 1983 , Article 535 of the principal Order applies in the form of section 253 of the Act of 1960 , without the amendment of that section made by Article 104 of the Order of 1982 . Effect of floating charge in winding up 19 . In relation to a charge created on or before 30th September 1960 , Article 573 ( 1 ) of the principal Order has effect with the substitution of "" 6 months "" for "" 12 months "" . Priority of old debts in winding up 20 . Nothing in this Order affects the priority to which any person may have been entitled under section 287 of the Act of 1960 in respect of a debt of any of the descriptions specified in paragraph ( a ) ( ii ) of subsection ( 1 ) of that section ( which included references to profits tax and excess profits tax ) . Savings as to certain old liquidations 21 . -- ( 1 ) The provisions of the principal Order with respect to winding up ( other than Article 588 and paragraph ( 2 )) do not apply to any company of which the winding up commenced before 1st January 1933 ; but every such company shall be wound up in the same manner and with the same incidents as if the M8 Companies Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1932 , the Act of 1960 and the principal Order ( apart from the provisions above-mentioned ) had not passed or been made ; and , for the purposes of the winding up , the statutory provision or provisions under which the winding up commenced are deemed to remain in full force . ( 2 ) An office copy of every order staying the proceedings in a winding up commenced as mentioned in paragraph ( 1 ) shall forthwith be forwarded by the company , or otherwise as may be prescribed , to the registrar for registration . Art . 22 rep . by SI 2001 / 3649 Art . 23--Amendments Repeals and continuity of law Art . 24 -- Repeals Continuity of law 25 . -- ( 1 ) In this Article -- ( a ) "" the Orders "" means the principal Order , the M9 Company Securities ( Insider Dealing ) ( Northern Ireland ) Order 1986 , the M10 Business Names ( Northern Ireland ) Order 1986 and this Order ; ( b ) "" the Acts "" means the Companies Acts ( Northern Ireland ) 1960 to 1983 and any other statutory provision which is repealed by this Order and replaced by a corresponding provision in the Orders ; and ( c ) "" the commencement date "" means the date on which this Order comes into operation . ( 2 ) Where any period of time specified in a provision of the Acts is current immediately before the commencement date , the Orders have effect as if the corresponding provision had been in force when the period began to run ; and ( without prejudice to the foregoing ) any period of time so specified and current is deemed for the purposes of the Orders -- ( a ) to run from the date or event from which it was running immediately before the commencement date , and ( b ) to expire ( subject to any provision of the Orders for its extension ) whenever it would have expired if the Orders had not been passed ; and any rights , priorities , liabilities , reliefs , obligations , requirements , powers , duties or exemptions dependent on the beginning , duration or end of such a period as above mentioned shall be under the Orders as they were or would have been under the Acts . ( 3 ) Where in any provision of the Orders there is a reference to another provision of those Orders , and the first-mentioned provision operates , or is capable of operating , in relation to things done or omitted , or events occurring or not occurring , in the past ( including in particular past acts of compliance with any statutory provision , failures of compliance , contraventions , offences and convictions of offences ) , the reference to that other provision is to be read as including a reference to the corresponding provision of the Acts . ( 4 ) A contravention of any provision of the Acts committed before the commencement date shall not be visited with any more severe punishment under or by virtue of the Orders than would have been applicable under that provision at the time of the contravention ; but -- ( a ) where an offence for the continuance of which a penalty was provided has been committed under any provision of the Acts , proceedings may be taken under the Orders in respect of the continuance of the offence after the commencement date in the like manner as if the offence had been committed under the corresponding provision of the Orders ; and ( b ) the repeal of any transitory provision of the Acts ( not replaced by any corresponding provision of the Orders ) requiring a thing to be done within a certain time does not affect a person's continued liability to be prosecuted and punished in respect of the failure , or continued failure , to do that thing . ( 5 ) The generality of section 29 ( 3 ) ( b ) of the M11 Interpretation Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1954 is not affected by any specific conversion of references made by this Order , nor by the inclusion in any provision of the Orders of a reference ( whether express or implied , and in whatever phraseology ) to the provision of the Acts corresponding to that provision , or to a provision of the Acts which is replaced by a corresponding provision of the Orders . ( 6 ) Nothing in the Orders affects -- ( a ) the registration or re-registration of any company under the former Companies Acts , or the continued existence of any company by virtue of such registration or re-registration ; or ( b ) the application of -- ( i ) Table B in the M12 Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 , or ( ii ) Table A in the M13 Companies Act 1862 , the M14 Companies ( Consolidation ) Act 1908 , the M15 Companies Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1932 or the Act of 1960 , to any company existing immediately before the commencement date ; or ( c ) the operation of any statutory provision providing for any partnership , association or company being wound up , or being wound up as a company or as an unregistered company under any of the former Companies Acts . ( 7 ) Anything saved from repeal by section 403 of the Act of 1960 and still in force immediately before the commencement date remains in force notwithstanding the repeal by this Order of any provision of that Act . ( 8 ) Where any provision of the Orders was , immediately before the commencement date , contained in or given effect by a statutory rule ( whether or not made under a power in any of the Acts ) , then -- ( a ) the foregoing provisions of this Article have effect as if that provision was contained in the Acts , and ( b ) insofar as the provision was , immediately before that date , subject to a power ( whether or not under the Acts ) of variation or revocation , nothing in the Orders is to be taken as prejudicing any future exercise of the power . ( 9 ) The provisions of this Article are without prejudice to the operation of sections 28 and 29 of the M16 Interpretation Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1954 ( savings from , and effect of , repeals ) ; and for the purposes of section 29 ( 3 ) of that Act ( effect of provisions repealing and re-enacting other provisions ) , any provision of the Acts which is replaced by a provision of the principal Order , the M17 Company Securities ( Insider Dealing ) ( Northern Ireland ) Order 1986 or the M18 Business Names ( Northern Ireland ) Order 1986 is deemed to have been repealed and re-enacted by that one of the Orders and not by this Order . </doc>

1154,932,A4,"Chapter indexed HTML of Villette , the novel by Charlotte Bronte ebooks of essential English literature free to read online sponsored external link to Lighting site II - Paulina Some days elapsed , and it appeared she was not likely to take much of a fancy to anybody in the house . She was not exactly naughty or wilful : she was far from disobedient ; but an object less conducive to comfort--to tranquillity even--than she presented , it was scarcely possible to have before one's eyes . She moped : no grown person could have performed that uncheering business better ; no furrowed face of adult exile , longing for Europe at Europe's antipodes , ever bore more legibly the signs of home sickness than did her infant visage . She seemed growing old and unearthly . I , Lucy Snowe , plead guiltless of that curse , an overheated and discursive imagination ; but whenever , opening a room-door , I found her seated in a corner alone , her head in her pigmy hand , that room seemed to me not inhabited , but haunted . And again , when of moonlight nights , on waking , I beheld her figure , white and conspicuous in its night-dress , kneeling upright in bed , and praying like some Catholic or Methodist enthusiast--some precocious fanatic or untimely saint--I scarcely know what thoughts I had ; but they ran risk of being hardly more rational and healthy than that child's mind must have been . I seldom caught a word of her prayers , for they were whispered low : sometimes , indeed , they were not whispered at all , but put up unuttered ; such rare sentences as reached my ear still bore the burden , "" Papa ; my dear papa ! "" This , I perceived , was a one-idea 'd nature ; betraying that monomaniac tendency I have ever thought the most unfortunate with which man or woman can be cursed . What might have been the end of this fretting , had it continued unchecked , can only be conjectured : it received , however , a sudden turn . One afternoon , Mrs. Bretton , coaxing her from her usual station in a corner , had lifted her into the window-seat , and , by way of occupying her attention , told her to watch the passengers and count how many ladies should go down the street in a given time . She had sat listlessly , hardly looking , and not counting , when--my eye being fixed on hers--I witnessed in its iris and pupil a startling transfiguration . These sudden , dangerous natures--_sensitive_ as they are called--offer many a curious spectacle to those whom a cooler temperament has secured from participation in their angular vagaries . The fixed and heavy gaze swum , trembled , then glittered in fire ; the small , overcast brow cleared ; the trivial and dejected features lit up ; the sad countenance vanished , and in its place appeared a sudden eagerness , an intense expectancy . "" It _is_ ! "" were her words . Like a bird or a shaft , or any other swift thing , she was gone from the room , How she got the house-door open I can not tell ; probably it might be ajar ; perhaps Warren was in the way and obeyed her behest , which would be impetuous enough . I--watching calmly from the window -- saw her , in her black frock and tiny braided apron ( to pinafores she had an antipathy ) , dart half the length of the street ; and , as I was on the point of turning , and quietly announcing to Mrs. Bretton that the child was run out mad , and ought instantly to be pursued , I saw her caught up , and rapt at once from my cool observation , and from the wondering stare of the passengers . A gentleman had done this good turn , and now , covering her with his cloak , advanced to restore her to the house whence he had seen her issue . I concluded he would leave her in a servant's charge and withdraw ; but he entered : having tarried a little while below , he came up-stairs . His reception immediately explained that he was known to Mrs. Bretton . She recognised him ; she greeted him , and yet she was fluttered , surprised , taken unawares . Her look and manner were even expostulatory ; and in reply to these , rather than her words , he said , -- "" I could not help it , madam : I found it impossible to leave the country without seeing with my own eyes how she settled . "" "" But you will unsettle her . "" "" I hope not . And how is papa's little Polly ? "" This question he addressed to Paulina , as he sat down and placed her gently on the ground before him . "" How is Polly's papa ? "" was the reply , as she leaned on his knee , and gazed up into his face . It was not a noisy , not a wordy scene : for that I was thankful ; but it was a scene of feeling too brimful , and which , because the cup did not foam up high or furiously overflow , only oppressed one the more . On all occasions of vehement , unrestrained expansion , a sense of disdain or ridicule comes to the weary spectator's relief ; whereas I have ever felt most burdensome that sort of sensibility which bends of its own will , a giant slave under the sway of good sense . Mr. Home was a stern-featured--perhaps I should rather say , a hard - featured man : his forehead was knotty , and his cheekbones were marked and prominent . The character of his face was quite Scotch ; but there was feeling in his eye , and emotion in his now agitated countenance . His northern accent in speaking harmonised with his physiognomy . He was at once proud-looking and homely-looking . He laid his hand on the child's uplifted head . She said -- "" Kiss Polly . "" He kissed her . I wished she would utter some hysterical cry , so that I might get relief and be at ease . She made wonderfully little noise : she seemed to have got what she wanted--_all_ she wanted , and to be in a trance of content . Neither in mien nor in features was this creature like her sire , and yet she was of his strain : her mind had been filled from his , as the cup from the flagon . Indisputably , Mr. Home owned manly self-control , however he might secretly feel on some matters . "" Polly , "" he said , looking down on his little girl , "" go into the hall ; you will see papa's great-coat lying on a chair ; put your hand into the pockets , you will find a pocket - handkerchief there ; bring it to me . "" She obeyed ; went and returned deftly and nimbly . He was talking to Mrs. Bretton when she came back , and she waited with the handkerchief in her hand . It was a picture , in its way , to see her , with her tiny stature , and trim , neat shape , standing at his knee . Seeing that he continued to talk , apparently unconscious of her return , she took his hand , opened the unresisting fingers , insinuated into them the handkerchief , and closed them upon it one by one . He still seemed not to see or to feel her ; but by-and-by , he lifted her to his knee ; she nestled against him , and though neither looked at nor spoke to the other for an hour following , I suppose both were satisfied . During tea , the minute thing's movements and behaviour gave , as usual , full occupation to the eye . First she directed Warren , as he placed the chairs . "" Put papa's chair here , and mine near it , between papa and Mrs. Bretton : _I_ must hand his tea . "" She took her own seat , and beckoned with her hand to her father . "" Be near me , as if we were at home , papa . "" And again , as she intercepted his cup in passing , and would stir the sugar , and put in the cream herself , "" I always did it for you at home ; papa : nobody could do it as well , not even your own self . "" Throughout the meal she continued her attentions : rather absurd they were . The sugar-tongs were too wide for one of her hands , and she had to use both in wielding them ; the weight of the silver cream-ewer , the bread-and-butter plates , the very cup and saucer , tasked her insufficient strength and dexterity ; but she would lift this , hand that , and luckily contrived through it all to break nothing . Candidly speaking , I thought her a little busy-body ; but her father , blind like other parents , seemed perfectly content to let her wait on him , and even wonderfully soothed by her offices . "" She is my comfort ! "" he could not help saying to Mrs. Bretton . That lady had her own "" comfort "" and nonpareil on a much larger scale , and , for the moment , absent ; so she sympathised with his foible . This second "" comfort "" came on the stage in the course of the evening . I knew this day had been fixed for his return , and was aware that Mrs. Bretton had been expecting him through all its hours . We were seated round the fire , after tea , when Graham joined our circle : I should rather say , broke it up--for , of course , his arrival made a bustle ; and then , as Mr. Graham was fasting , there was refreshment to be provided . He and Mr. Home met as old acquaintance ; of the little girl he took no notice for a time . His meal over , and numerous questions from his mother answered , he turned from the table to the hearth . Opposite where he had placed himself was seated Mr. Home , and at his elbow , the child . When I say _child_ I use an inappropriate and undescriptive term--a term suggesting any picture rather than that of the demure little person in a mourning frock and white chemisette , that might just have fitted a good-sized doll--perched now on a high chair beside a stand , whereon was her toy work-box of white varnished wood , and holding in her hands a shred of a handkerchief , which she was professing to hem , and at which she bored perseveringly with a needle , that in her fingers seemed almost a skewer , pricking herself ever and anon , marking the cambric with a track of minute red dots ; occasionally starting when the perverse weapon--swerving from her control--inflicted a deeper stab than usual ; but still silent , diligent , absorbed , womanly . Graham was at that time a handsome , faithless-looking youth of sixteen . I say faithless-looking , not because he was really of a very perfidious disposition , but because the epithet strikes me as proper to describe the fair , Celtic ( not Saxon ) character of his good looks ; his waved light auburn hair , his supple symmetry , his smile frequent , and destitute neither of fascination nor of subtlety ( in no bad sense ) . A spoiled , whimsical boy he was in those days . "" Mother , "" he said , after eyeing the little figure before him in silence for some time , and when the temporary absence of Mr. Home from the room relieved him from the half-laughing bashfulness , which was all he knew of timidity --- "" Mother , I see a young lady in the present society to whom I have not been introduced . "" "" Mr. Home's little girl , I suppose you mean , "" said his mother . "" Indeed , ma ' am , "" replied her son , "" I consider your expression of the least ceremonious : Miss Home _I_ should certainly have said , in venturing to speak of the gentlewoman to whom I allude . "" "" Now , Graham , I will not have that child teased . Do n't flatter yourself that I shall suffer you to make her your butt . "" "" Miss Home , "" pursued Graham , undeterred by his mother's remonstrance , "" might I have the honour to introduce myself , since no one else seems willing to render you and me that service ? Your slave , John Graham Bretton . "" She looked at him ; he rose and bowed quite gravely . She deliberately put down thimble , scissors , work ; descended with precaution from her perch , and curtsying with unspeakable seriousness , said , "" How do you do ? "" "" I have the honour to be in fair health , only in some measure fatigued with a hurried journey . I hope , ma ' am , I see you well ? "" "" Tor-rer-ably well , "" was the ambitious reply of the little woman and she now essayed to regain her former elevation , but finding this could not be done without some climbing and straining--a sacrifice of decorum not to be thought of--and being utterly disdainful of aid in the presence of a strange young gentleman , she relinquished the high chair for a low stool : towards that low stool Graham drew in his chair . "" I hope , ma ' am , the present residence , my mother's house , appears to you a convenient place of abode ? "" "" Not par-tic-er-er-ly ; I want to go home . "" "" A natural and laudable desire , ma ' am ; but one which , notwithstanding , I shall do my best to oppose . I reckon on being able to get out of you a little of that precious commodity called amusement , which mamma and Mistress Snowe there fail to yield me . "" "" I shall have to go with papa soon : I shall not stay long at your mother's . "" "" Yes , yes ; you will stay with me , I am sure . I have a pony on which you shall ride , and no end of books with pictures to show you . "" "" Are _you_ going to live here now ? "" "" I am . Does that please you ? Do you like me ? "" "" No. "" "" Why ? "" "" I think you queer . "" "" My face , ma ' am ? "" "" Your face and all about you : You have long red hair . "" "" Auburn hair , if you please : mamma , calls it auburn , or golden , and so do all her friends . But even with my ' long red hair ' "" ( and he waved his mane with a sort of triumph--tawny he himself well knew that it was , and he was proud of the leonine hue ) , "" I can not possibly be queerer than is your ladyship . "" "" You call me queer ? "" "" Certainly . "" ( After a pause ) , "" I think I shall go to bed . "" "" A little thing like you ought to have been in bed many hours since ; but you probably sat up in the expectation of seeing me ? "" "" No , indeed . "" "" You certainly wished to enjoy the pleasure of my society . You knew I was coming home , and would wait to have a look at me . "" "" I sat up for papa , and not for you . "" "" Very good , Miss Home . I am going to be a favourite : preferred before papa soon , I daresay . "" She wished Mrs. Bretton and myself good-night ; she seemed hesitating whether Graham's deserts entitled him to the same attention , when he caught her up with one hand , and with that one hand held her poised aloft above his head . She saw herself thus lifted up on high , in the glass over the fireplace . The suddenness , the freedom , the disrespect of the action were too much . "" For shame , Mr. Graham ! "" was her indignant cry , "" put me down ! "" -- and when again on her feet , "" I wonder what you would think of me if I were to treat you in that way , lifting you with my hand "" ( raising that mighty member ) "" as Warren lifts the little cat . "" So saying , she departed . </doc>

562,17,A1,"Reshaping China's Government-Services Supply Chain HONG KONG – A supply chain links producers and consumers through a complex web of outsourcing contracts , with market leaders in any product category orchestrating activities to produce components profitably along its entire length . For example , an iPad is designed in California – with chips from Japan and parts from South Korea , Taiwan , and elsewhere – and finally assembled in China for global distribution . But the ecology of supply chains is not as straightforward as this depiction suggests . Most studies of supply chains examine their operations , but take for granted governments' critical enabling role . Because the non-delivery of government services would inhibit the proper functioning of business supply chains , understanding how the government-services supply chain works is vital . For example , the Chinese economy's transformation was enabled by the synchronized delivery of government services to support the logistics , finance , and manufacturing supply chains . This was a complex task that involved different levels of the Chinese government and many state agencies and ministries . A supply chain is not only a network for production , but also a live feedback mechanism , continually adjusting itself to ensure that production is coordinated and aligned efficiently to meet changes in global consumers' demand , tastes , and preferences . Technology has enabled faster , more efficient "" just-in-time "" delivery , taking full advantage of specialization and knowledge-sharing on a global scale . As Apple has discovered , the winner in orchestrating a supply chain emerges with the lowest global costs and the largest market share . The iPad could not be produced at such high speed and low cost without the "" made-in-the-world "" supply chain based in China . In addition to the macro and micro aspects of economics , understanding supply chains in private and public goods and services in China requires [ 178 ] mezo ( institutional ) and meta ( system-wide ) analysis . When China initiated its economic reforms in 1979 , it inherited a centrally planned economy that lacked the institutional infrastructure for markets . Recognizing the need for systemic change , China allowed local governments in special economic zones and cities to experiment with modern legal , administrative , and logistical practices for export industries , including investments in utilities and transport . Intense competition among local governments for foreign investment led to dramatic improvements in the business environment , featuring economic incentives in areas like land , labor , and taxation , as well as speedy issuance of permits and approvals . City leaders were given responsibility for mobilizing local resources to generate GDP and employment , and they were ( and continue to be ) rewarded with promotion for good performance . The result was considerable innovation and institutionalization of local government services to support market activities , including outsourcing of expertise in infrastructure project design , administration , and operations to private and foreign consulting and design companies . To support China's participation in global manufacturing supply chains , many local governments sold and dismantled their state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , enabling many new private firms to provide the services needed for an export-oriented , market-based economy . At the national level , the consolidation of SOEs and banks , and the modernization of their corporate governance via public listing on stock exchanges , enabled improved efficiency in regulated utilities , hard infrastructure , and resource sectors , complementing liberalization and market growth . The Chinese government-services supply chain also benefited substantially from a meritocratic human-resources tradition . Officials with substantial and successful experience in local governments , ministries , or SOEs were deliberately promoted and cross-posted to less-developed regions to spread know-how , technology , and best practices and processes . Indeed , China's economic success reflects the depth of administrative and market experience embedded in the Chinese bureaucracy . Chinese mayors are CEOs of their local economy , responsible not only for market development , but also for social stability . The critical mechanism for orchestrating and implementing the complex web of contracts embodied in China's government-services supply chain is the Five-Year Plan , which foresees vertical and horizontal integration of almost all Party and administrative agencies . The FYP uses broad objectives and targets for social and economic development , formed after extensive internal and public consultations . These mandates are translated by sub-national officials into projects and work plans , such as targets for reducing energy use per unit of GDP in order to address resource constraints and concern about climate change . China's success in developing from scratch a modern government-services delivery system explains why many foreign investors find it much easier to deal with Chinese governments than those in other developing countries . The 12th FYP aims to shift China from an export-driven growth model toward a balanced economy that relies on domestic demand , while simultaneously addressing industrial transformation , social inequities , and environmental degradation . This implies more complex contracts that go beyond promoting markets , GDP growth , and employment to ensure inclusive , equitable , and high-quality government-services delivery . Implementation of these evolving social goals through local government agencies by specific officials is a daunting task that requires profound changes in roles and performance metrics . No one doubts that Chinese local governments play a much more active and intrusive role than their counterparts in the West , which implies an additional complicating factor . Local governments now face not only growing demands from the emerging middle class for greater transparency , competition , fairness , and access to opportunities , but also deepening conflicts between local interests and global rules . Orchestrating a complex government-services supply chain in a substantially open continental economy with 1.3 billion people and five levels of government is difficult enough using a simple GDP growth objective . Adapting the governance metric in a country of China's size to an economy that is green , inclusive , and equitable presents a novel challenge in human history . The only precedent for such an achievement is China itself . </doc>

957,1584,A1,"PDAs Bring Hand-Held Solutions to Healthcare Author Email Personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) have found a niche in the healthcare market since their inception several years ago , and today the devices give doctors and nurses a critical wireless connection to patient records and Web-based databases to aid diagnosis and treatment . PDAs are no longer just for keeping track of appointments , as hospitals and healthcare systems now integrate PDA connectivity into their computer networks to allow access to patient records . This has allowed clinicians to keep up to the minute on patient conditions and review information from tests and patient vital signs even if they are not in the hospital . Connecting PDAs to hospital systems When hospitals issue PDAs to their staffs , the key is making the information they can access meaningful with connectivity to the hospital computer networks . SOTI Inc. is one company that provides software to connect PDA devices to hospital systems and patient electronic medical records ( EMRs ) . It also allows large networks of these mobile devices to be managed remotely by hospital IT staff . Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in Kansas City , MO , has issued more than 400 HP iPAQ Pocket PCs to its doctors , residents and nurse practitioners in every department . Via SOTI , clinicians can gain encrypted access to an abbreviated version of patients' EMRs to review and enter information and type in notes , look at summaries of patients' vital signs , radiology notes , lab results , and retrieve and copy previously entered patient notes to save time . "" The main reason we give the iPAQs to them is because all of our inpatient notes are now done electronically – we do n't do any writing-out of notes anymore , "" said Jeyson Peters , Children's Mercy's systems analyst who maintains the network of iPAQs using SOTI . He said the devices are also installed with Lexicon , a drug reference and interaction checking software with built-in drug calculators , and M.D. On Tap , a medical search engine that will seek out information helpful for diagnosis and treatment options . SOTI allows regular automatic software updates when the devices connect to WiFi . Peters also said the iPAQs have access to the Internet , eMail , a calendar to enter appointments , Pocket Word , Excel and Powerpoint . The devices have a 4-6 day battery life between recharges , unless there is extensive , constant WiFi use , which can drop the battery life to 10-12 hours , he said . The residents do not have offices , so the iPAQ allows them to work wherever and whenever they have time , he said . The iPAQs have been especially handy when doctors visit area outreach clinics and are able to carry their entire office in their pocket and have immediate access to hospital records . The SOTI system allows Peters to troubleshoot problems and to remotely access any iPAQ encountering problems , regardless if the PDA is located in the hospital or 100 miles away . SOTI software makes remote devices work over any network , and allows the creation of customized reports and full integration of third-party reporting tools . The system can also locate and track mobile assets . Security features include authentication , encryption and device lockdown features to disable the cell phone , Bluetooth or camera features on mobile devices to prevent dissemination of patient information . SOTI's software allows for data synchronization between network servers and mobile devices . "" One of the biggest advantages with SOTI is being able to update the software and to create rules for things like when updates occur , "" Peters said . "" If a doctor has a problem , I can remote in and fix the problem . "" Since doctors also way have a computer in their pocket , it is also easier for them to enter their own notes , instead of relying on a transcription service , which is where Peters said the PDA devices have paid for themselves . "" It has definitely saved us money , "" Peters said . "" There are some doctors who would otherwise have us pay for the transcription of hundreds of pages of notes . "" That return on investment is encouraged among residents by allowing them to keep their iPAQ at the end of their four years at the hospital if they use it to enter their own notes . Peters said the ROI was also the key selling point with the hospital's chief financial officer when the idea of purchasing PDAs was first discussed . "" A lot of the doctors like the PDAs because they fit in their coat pocket , "" Peters said . "" We do n't get many complaints . "" Children's Mercy chose iPAQs because the pocket PCs were more robust and can run more software than smaller smartphones , Peters explained . However , he said the limitations on the IPAQs include a very tiny keyboard , which requires many people to use a stylus to tap the letters . "" Our biggest limitation is just accessing the WiFi on pocket devices , "" Peters said . "" They do not seem to be as intelligent as our laptops . "" He said the iPAQs sometimes do n't differentiate between the hospital's nonencrypted public access network and its encrypted clinical network . Opus Mobility is another company that offers several PDA software solutions for plans of care , electronic charting , work orders , test results , evidence-based medicine and decision support , anatomic pathology and microbiology modules and drug references . The software integrates PDAs and smartphones with hospitals' clinical documentation systems so clinicians can get patient data and vital signs reformatted into a distilled version so it fits on the smaller screens . The system is designed to use a stylus to allow the user to scroll and zoom into information . It transmits clinical information to a cellphone or PDA over a hospital's wireless network , or if outside the hospital , over any of the major cell phone networks . It will work on any Windows Mobile phone . If a healthcare facility does not use the Opus clinical suite , the company said it is compatible with the top 10 hospital information systems . It is an HL7-based system . Opus Mobility has been in use in several hospitals for more than a year and as of this spring was being installed in five more facilities . Patient safety in palm of your hand Volumes of clinical information are available anywhere at clinicians' fingertips with the help of the Internet and PDAs or smartphones . Dozens of universities and companies offer clinical reference software for wireless PDA devices , ranging from anatomical images , drug and dosing references and disease diagnosis and treatment references . Web-based healthcare software maker Epocrates Inc. has developed Web-based products to help clinicians reduce medical errors , improve patient care and increase productivity . It integrates references on drugs , diseases and diagnostics , a medical dictionary and a reference for CPT codes . He started using Epocrates shortly after it was introduced 10 years ago . Dr. Rugg uses Epocrates Multicheck at the bedside to check for interactions between numerous prescribed and over the counter drugs a patient may be given . He can add in the medications he recommends to check for potential interactions . The database , which is updated weekly , also gives clinicians access to formularies , dosage calculators , providing dosing based on parameters such as renal insufficiency or weight in pediatric patients . Using Epocrates ID , Dr. Rugg can search symptoms , find out about an infectious process or an organism , and get recommendations for appropriate medications . He said all his residency students are issued PDAs with Epocrates to aid them when confronting diagnosis and drug questions in the ED . Dr. Rugg used Epocrates on a Palm PDA , but now uses a Blackberry . He said the database for the Blackberry is not as full as the Palm , but additions are being made regularly . The company supports PDAs and smartphones that use the Palm , Windows Mobile and Blackberry operating systems . </doc>

975,222,A8,"Report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Abkhazia , Georgia Introduction The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution 1427 ( 2002 ) of 29 July 2002 , by which the Council decided to extend the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia ( UNOMIG ) until 31 January 2003 and requested me to report three months from the date of the adoption of the resolution . It provides an update on developments since my report of 10 July 2002 ( S / 2002 / 742 ) . Heidi Tagliavini continued to head UNOMIG as my Special Representative for Georgia , and Major General Kazi Ashfaq Ahmed ( Bangladesh ) continued to serve as the Chief Military Observer . The strength of UNOMIG on 1 October 2002 stood at 108 military observers ( see annex ) . Political process During the period under review , UNOMIG continued to search for ways to engage the Georgian and Abkhaz sides on the paper entitled "" Basic Principles for the Distribution of Competences between Tbilisi and Sukhumi "" and its transmittal letter , as a step towards holding substantial negotiations on the core issue of the conflict , namely , the future status of Abkhazia within the State of Georgia . In these efforts , it had the support of the Group of Friends of the Secretary-General . At the same time , UNOMIG devoted considerable energy to the situation in the Kodori Valley , which remained a major source of tension . The situation in the wider area remained tense in the context of which UNOMIG carries out its work . In addition to consulting with the leadership of the two sides , and in order to find ways to move the political process forward and overcome continuing Abkhaz refusal to even discuss the paper on competences , my Special Representative embarked on a round of consultations in the capitals of the Member States constituting the Group of Friends . In August and September , she visited Moscow , Washington and Berlin and she intends to visit London and Paris in the near future . She also conducted consultations at Headquarters in New York . The efforts to arrange a meeting in Sukhumi at which my Special Representative , together with the representatives of the Group of Friends , would familiarize the Abkhaz leadership with the substance of the paper on competences ( see S / 2002 / 742 , para . 4 ) have not succeeded so far . In view of this , and in consultation with the Group of Friends and my Special Representative , the Russian Federation offered to facilitate a meeting in Moscow with the de facto Abkhaz Prime Minister , Anri Jergenia . It was envisaged that , at that meeting , Mr. Jergenia would be acquainted with the substance of the paper on competences and the rationale behind it , but that it would not be handed over ; Mr. Jergenia in turn would have the opportunity to explain his views on the settlement of the conflict . The meeting was scheduled for 5 October but it was not held because Mr. Jergenia rejected a discussion of the paper and the participation of my Special Representative . UNOMIG continued its efforts to bring the two sides together in the framework of the Coordinating Council . While it again proved to be impossible to arrange a meeting of the Council itself , the sides did meet on 20 July in Working Groups I ( on security matters ) and II ( on internally displaced persons and refugees ) of the Council . They also met several times , both in the presence of UNOMIG and bilaterally , to discuss the situation in and around the Kodori Valley . Operational activities The UNOMIG military observers continued to perform their mandated tasks through daily ground patrols in the Gali and Zugdidi sectors , as well as two - or three-day patrols in the Kodori Valley , the latter jointly with the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) peacekeeping force . On three occasions the patrols had to be cancelled because of the lack of security guarantees . Patrolling by helicopter remained suspended ; administrative flights were conducted following a flight path over the Black Sea . The investigation into the shooting down of a UNOMIG helicopter on 8 October 2001 is to be completed by the end of October 2002 . Kodori Valley Following the gradual stabilization of the situation in and around the Kodori Valley in May and June ( see S / 2002 / 742 , para . 10 ) , a joint UNOMIG / CIS patrol was conducted from 16 to 18 July . It assessed the situation as calm but unstable ; the mortars and ammunition observed in the Georgian-controlled upper valley by earlier patrols ( see S / 2002 / 742 , para . 11 ) had , however , still not been removed . On 20 July , Working Group I of the Coordinating Council met under the chairmanship of the Chief Military Observer to discuss measures to further stabilize the situation in the Kodori Valley . The Georgian side stated that it had reduced the number of border guards and undertook again to remove the military equipment from the valley . Late in July , the situation took a turn for the worse . On 30 July , the Georgian authorities informed UNOMIG that Abkhaz troops had been spotted near the Marukhi Pass ( on the Russian-Georgian border ) which is connected to the upper Kodori Valley by the approximately 40-kilometre long Chkhalta Valley . On the same day , the Abkhaz side informed UNOMIG that several Georgian helicopters had landed troops close to the pass ; it threatened military action if the Georgian side did not withdraw immediately . On 31 July , a UNOMIG / CIS patrol was told by Georgian officials that a Russian helicopter carrying troops had landed south of the Marukhi Pass . Later in the day , the Georgian Defence Minister and the Chief of the National Guard arrived in the Kodori Valley and went to the Marukhi Pass . On their return , the two officials stated to the UNOMIG patrol that the Russian helicopter had flown into the area mistakenly and that the situation had been resolved . Also on 31 July , UNOMIG received a letter from the Abkhaz side , expressing strong concerns about Georgian landings in the Marukhi Pass area the day before and informing UNOMIG that several checkpoints would be established there to prevent infiltration by "" international terrorists "" and "" illegal actions "" by the Georgian side . As the tensions were mounting , UNOMIG worked with the two parties to prevent a resort to force . On 4 August , it arranged a meeting between the Georgian State Minister , Avtandil Jorbenadze , and Mr. Jergenia on the Inguri River bridge . At that meeting , and a follow-up meeting of the respective Chiefs of General Staff on 6 August , the parties agreed to withdraw their units from the Marukhi Pass area and jointly inspect it as soon as possible . That inspection has not so far been carried out . The parties also requested UNOMIG to participate in the inspection and consider establishing a permanent post in the upper Kodori Valley . During the following days , the tensions continued . The Georgian side accused the Abkhaz of moving their forces to Georgian-controlled territory near the Marukhi Pass and firing on a border guard helicopter . On 13 August , another high-level meeting between the two sides was convened . Soon after the talks started , however , the Georgian delegation received a report that fighting had broken out between the two sides near the Marukhi Pass . The meeting was suspended , and the Georgian delegation flew to the area to clarify the situation . It returned later that day and stated that Abkhaz armed units had moved forward from their positions into the Chkhalta Valley and that Georgian forces had opened fire . On 14 August , the Defence Ministers of the two sides met . They again agreed to withdraw their forces from the positions in the Marukhi Pass area , to remove jointly newly laid mines there , and to request UNOMIG and the CIS peacekeeping force to monitor the withdrawal and mine clearing . A joint UNOMIG / CIS patrol to the Kodori Valley planned for mid-August was cancelled because the Georgian authorities did not provide the necessary security guarantees . The planned joint mine clearance has not been carried out so far , because the sides at subsequent technical meetings , could not agree on the modalities for the operation . Despite this lack of tangible results of the various meetings , they succeeded in defusing the tensions for the time being and a joint UNOMIG / CIS patrol to the Kodori Valley was conducted from 31 August to 2 September . It found that the Abkhaz side was repairing the road in the lower part of the valley and that the CIS checkpoints there had increased their protective measures ; the Georgian mortars and ammunition in the upper valley had still not been removed . The next two patrols , however , planned to start on 12 and 25 September respectively , were cancelled , the first because the Georgian side had not cleared the mines at the entrance to the Georgian-controlled upper part of the valley ( as is the usual procedure ) , and the second because the Abkhaz side did not provide security clearance for the Abkhaz-controlled lower part , owing to the alleged presence of armed irregulars there . A patrol did go to the Kodori Valley from 3 to 8 October and observed the removal of the Georgian mortars and ammunition from the valley . Gali and Zugdidi sectors The general security situation in the Gali sector was calm , with the exception of the lower Gali area , where there were two particularly violent shooting incidents . The first was an exchange of fire between the Abkhaz militia and an unidentified armed group during the night of 31 August / 1 September at Khumuskhuri ( about 15 kilometres south-west of Gali city ) ; three members of the armed group were killed . The second occurred on 25 September , when three Abkhaz officials were killed in an ambush in broad daylight near the main bridge across the Inguri River . There were also a number of shootings at Abkhaz and CIS positions , as well as two explosions ; none of these incidents led to fatalities . There was the usual upsurge in robberies during the hazelnut harvest , though the crime rate overall was lower than in previous years . Still , 14 robberies were reported , as well as a number of tit-for-tat abduction cases . The activities of local law enforcement agencies are seen as insufficient by the returnee population in the lower Gali area . In order to explore ways of strengthening the law enforcement agencies , my Special Representative continued consultations with the two sides . In this connection , a meeting of Working Group II of the Coordinating Council was convened on 20 July , chaired by the representative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) to Georgia . Working Group II had previously only met twice in 1998 . The outcome included a request for UNOMIG to dispatch a security assessment team to the Gali and Zugdidi districts later this year , as a follow-up to the recommendations of the joint assessment mission undertaken in November 2000 ( see S / 2001 / 59 , annex II ) . The assessment team will provide options and make recommendations to my Special Representative for improving the effectiveness of law enforcement personnel and agencies and their cooperation with the judiciary , with the aim of creating a safer and more secure environment for persons wishing to exercise their right of return or having already returned . Working Group II also agreed that the problems of the returnee population would become a topic for the weekly quadripartite meetings ( these meetings bring together the two parties , UNOMIG and the CIS peacekeeping force for a regular exchange on practical issues on the ground ) . The general security situation in the Zugdidi sector was calm . The law and order situation has improved to some extent ; there were only two robberies reported to UNOMIG during the reporting period . Criminal activities across the ceasefire line nevertheless remained a problem , and often perpetrators of crimes on one side flee to the other side to take refuge . Demonstrations by internally displaced persons , including a blockade of the main bridge over the Inguri River from 22 August to 5 September , reflected the desperation among the refugees 10 years after the start of the hostilities . They demanded the proper payment of their allowances , the withdrawal of the CIS peacekeeping force and the prompt return of refugees to their original homes . As a result of heavy rainfall at the end of June , a significant number of bridges and roads within the Zugdidi sector were either damaged or destroyed , which had a negative effect on UNOMIG patrols . Cooperation with the collective peacekeeping force of the Commonwealth of Independent States UNOMIG and the CIS peacekeeping force continued to work in close cooperation , in particular in conducting the joint patrols to the Kodori Valley , and maintained good relations at all levels . The staff of the two organizations held regular meetings , complementing the exchanges between the Chief Military Observer and the CIS Force Commander . The weekly quadripartite meetings and the activities of the Joint Fact-Finding Group also remained useful platforms for information sharing and coordination . Humanitarian situation and human rights International humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations continued their programmes , targeting the acute food and medical needs of the most vulnerable segments of the population in Abkhazia , and conducted mine-clearance , small-scale rehabilitation and community development activities . Their operations continued to be hampered by restrictions on border crossings at the Psou River . UNHCR continued its limited humanitarian operation in Abkhazia , against the background of recurrent concerns about security and criminality . In cooperation with local authorities and beneficiary communities , it pursued the basic rehabilitation of school buildings , as endorsed by the parties in Working Group III of the Coordinating Council . This year , the emphasis of this activity , which covers 49 schools , is in areas beyond the Gali district . The project has essentially been implemented , though some construction work remains to be completed by the local communities . A group of vulnerable elderly persons in Sukhumi continued to benefit from a small-scale UNHCR assistance programme through a local non-governmental implementing partner . Following the establishment of a sub-account for humanitarian quick-impact projects in the UNOMIG Trust Fund , efforts are under way to obtain funding for a number of projects that have been identified . The human rights situation in Abkhazia remained fragile , particularly in the security zone at the Gali side of the ceasefire line . The Mission's Human Rights Office continued to promote human rights awareness through a specialized programme on a district television station and the publication of two United Nations human rights documents in the Abkhaz language , "" Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement "" and "" Minority Rights "" . It also started to participate in the weekly quadripartite meetings , following the decision by Working Group II that returnee issues would be discussed regularly in that forum . Support issues UNOMIG has now installed two more satellite communication stations , thereby providing full interconnectivity throughout the Mission area , including the two sectors . A further 14 microwave systems are being deployed in the Mission area . The VHF network has been expanded from 16 to 32 channels to make provision for operational , evacuation , security , air operations and medevac / search and rescue channels . Observations During the period reviewed in this report , the situation in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone has , unfortunately , not improved . In the absence of a substantive negotiation process on the core issue of the conflict – the status of Abkhazia within the State of Georgia – upsurges of tension , including exchanges of gunfire , continued to occur with alarming frequency , while the population suffered from crime , partisan violence and the lack of economic development . To reduce these tensions , the Abkhaz side needs to reconsider its refusal even to discuss the paper "" Basic Principles of the Distribution of Competences between Tbilisi and Sukhumi "" and its transmittal letter , which is , after all , only the starting point for negotiations in which the legitimate interests of the multi-ethnic population of Abkhazia can be addressed . The Georgian side , for its part , needs to make more efforts to promote trust and confidence on the Abkhaz side . My Special Representative will continue her efforts , with the support of the Group of Friends , to encourage advancement in the political process , but the basic responsibility lies with the parties . The Kodori Valley has been a source of tension for more than a year . UNOMIG will continue its efforts to defuse tensions emanating from the area and bring the parties together to address the underlying problems . However , again it is up to the parties , who exercise control in this area , to do their part to prevent destabilization and create the security conditions in which UNOMIG can function . It is deplorable that there has been no progress on refugee returns , owing to the absence of the safe , secure and dignified conditions under which such returns are to be effected according to international law and the 1994 Quadripartite Agreement . The UNOMIG security assessment team will seek to identify ways in which the existing law enforcement personnel and institutions can improve their effectiveness in combating criminal activities and strengthening the rule of law . One year after the shooting down of a United Nations helicopter , as UNOMIG remembers its colleagues who lost their lives in the service of peace , the perpetrators of the crime are still at large , as are those responsible for taking UNOMIG personnel hostage in several incidents from 1998 to 2000 . Every effort must be made to apprehend them and bring them to trial . In conclusion , I should like to express my appreciation for the steadfastness and dedication with which my Special Representative , Heidi Tagliavini , the Chief Military Observer , Major General Kazi Ashfaq Ahmed , and the men and women of UNOMIG have carried out their difficult and often dangerous duties .

699,44,A4,"The little mermaid Far out in the ocean , where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower , and as clear as crystal , it is very , very deep ; so deep , indeed , that no cable could fathom it : many church steeples , piled one upon another , would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above . There dwell the Sea King and his subjects . We must not imagine that there is nothing at the bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand . No , indeed ; the most singular flowers and plants grow there ; the leaves and stems of which are so pliant , that the slightest agitation of the water causes them to stir as if they had life . Fishes , both large and small , glide between the branches , as birds fly among the trees here upon land . In the deepest spot of all , stands the castle of the Sea King . Its walls are built of coral , and the long , gothic windows are of the clearest amber . The roof is formed of shells , that open and close as the water flows over them . Their appearance is very beautiful , for in each lies a glittering pearl , which would be fit for the diadem of a queen . The Sea King had been a widower for many years , and his aged mother kept house for him . She was a very wise woman , and exceedingly proud of her high birth ; on that account she wore twelve oysters on her tail ; while others , also of high rank , were only allowed to wear six . She was , however , deserving of very great praise , especially for her care of the little sea-princesses , her grand-daughters . They were six beautiful children ; but the youngest was the prettiest of them all ; her skin was as clear and delicate as a rose-leaf , and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea ; but , like all the others , she had no feet , and her body ended in a fish's tail . All day long they played in the great halls of the castle , or among the living flowers that grew out of the walls . The large amber windows were open , and the fish swam in , just as the swallows fly into our houses when we open the windows , excepting that the fishes swam up to the princesses , ate out of their hands , and allowed themselves to be stroked . Outside the castle there was a beautiful garden , in which grew bright red and dark blue flowers , and blossoms like flames of fire ; the fruit glittered like gold , and the leaves and stems waved to and fro continually . The earth itself was the finest sand , but blue as the flame of burning sulphur . Over everything lay a peculiar blue radiance , as if it were surrounded by the air from above , through which the blue sky shone , instead of the dark depths of the sea . In calm weather the sun could be seen , looking like a purple flower , with the light streaming from the calyx . Each of the young princesses had a little plot of ground in the garden , where she might dig and plant as she pleased . One arranged her flower-bed into the form of a whale ; another thought it better to make hers like the figure of a little mermaid ; but that of the youngest was round like the sun , and contained flowers as red as his rays at sunset . She was a strange child , quiet and thoughtful ; and while her sisters would be delighted with the wonderful things which they obtained from the wrecks of vessels , she cared for nothing but her pretty red flowers , like the sun , excepting a beautiful marble statue . It was the representation of a handsome boy , carved out of pure white stone , which had fallen to the bottom of the sea from a wreck . She planted by the statue a rose-colored weeping willow . It grew splendidly , and very soon hung its fresh branches over the statue , almost down to the blue sands . The shadow had a violet tint , and waved to and fro like the branches ; it seemed as if the crown of the tree and the root were at play , and trying to kiss each other . Nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear about the world above the sea . She made her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the ships and of the towns , the people and the animals . To her it seemed most wonderful and beautiful to hear that the flowers of the land should have fragrance , and not those below the sea ; that the trees of the forest should be green ; and that the fishes among the trees could sing so sweetly , that it was quite a pleasure to hear them . Her grandmother called the little birds fishes , or she would not have understood her ; for she had never seen birds . "" When you have reached your fifteenth year , "" said the grand-mother , "" you will have permission to rise up out of the sea , to sit on the rocks in the moonlight , while the great ships are sailing by ; and then you will see both forests and towns . "" In the following year , one of the sisters would be fifteen : but as each was a year younger than the other , the youngest would have to wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom of the ocean , and see the earth as we do . However , each promised to tell the others what she saw on her first visit , and what she thought the most beautiful ; for their grandmother could not tell them enough ; there were so many things on which they wanted information . None of them longed so much for her turn to come as the youngest , she who had the longest time to wait , and who was so quiet and thoughtful . Many nights she stood by the open window , looking up through the dark blue water , and watching the fish as they splashed about with their fins and tails . She could see the moon and stars shining faintly ; but through the water they looked larger than they do to our eyes . When something like a black cloud passed between her and them , she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head , or a ship full of human beings , who never imagined that a pretty little mermaid was standing beneath them , holding out her white hands towards the keel of their ship . As soon as the eldest was fifteen , she was allowed to rise to the surface of the ocean . When she came back , she had hundreds of things to talk about ; but the most beautiful , she said , was to lie in the moonlight , on a sandbank , in the quiet sea , near the coast , and to gaze on a large town nearby , where the lights were twinkling like hundreds of stars ; to listen to the sounds of the music , the noise of carriages , and the voices of human beings , and then to hear the merry bells peal out from the church steeples ; and because she could not go near to all those wonderful things , she longed for them more than ever . Oh , did not the youngest sister listen eagerly to all these descriptions ? and afterwards , when she stood at the open window looking up through the dark blue water , she thought of the great city , with all its bustle and noise , and even fancied she could hear the sound of the church bells , down in the depths of the sea . In another year the second sister received permission to rise to the surface of the water , and to swim about where she pleased . She rose just as the sun was setting , and this , she said , was the most beautiful sight of all . The whole sky looked like gold , while violet and rose-colored clouds , which she could not describe , floated over her ; and , still more rapidly than the clouds , flew a large flock of wild swans towards the setting sun , looking like a long white veil across the sea . She also swam towards the sun ; but it sunk into the waves , and the rosy tints faded from the clouds and from the sea . The third sister's turn followed ; she was the boldest of them all , and she swam up a broad river that emptied itself into the sea . On the banks she saw green hills covered with beautiful vines ; palaces and castles peeped out from amid the proud trees of the forest ; she heard the birds singing , and the rays of the sun were so powerful that she was obliged often to dive down under the water to cool her burning face . In a narrow creek she found a whole troop of little human children , quite naked , and sporting about in the water ; she wanted to play with them , but they fled in a great fright ; and then a little black animal came to the water ; it was a dog , but she did not know that , for she had never before seen one . This animal barked at her so terribly that she became frightened , and rushed back to the open sea . But she said she should never forget the beautiful forest , the green hills , and the pretty little children who could swim in the water , although they had not fish's tails . The fourth sister was more timid ; she remained in the midst of the sea , but she said it was quite as beautiful there as nearer the land . She could see for so many miles around her , and the sky above looked like a bell of glass . She had seen the ships , but at such a great distance that they looked like sea-gulls . The dolphins sported in the waves , and the great whales spouted water from their nostrils till it seemed as if a hundred fountains were playing in every direction . The fifth sister's birthday occurred in the winter ; so when her turn came , she saw what the others had not seen the first time they went up . The sea looked quite green , and large icebergs were floating about , each like a pearl , she said , but larger and loftier than the churches built by men . They were of the most singular shapes , and glittered like diamonds . She had seated herself upon one of the largest , and let the wind play with her long hair , and she remarked that all the ships sailed by rapidly , and steered as far away as they could from the iceberg , as if they were afraid of it . Towards evening , as the sun went down , dark clouds covered the sky , the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed , and the red light glowed on the icebergs as they rocked and tossed on the heaving sea . On all the ships the sails were reefed with fear and trembling , while she sat calmly on the floating iceberg , watching the blue lightning , as it darted its forked flashes into the sea . When first the sisters had permission to rise to the surface , they were each delighted with the new and beautiful sights they saw ; but now , as grown-up girls , they could go when they pleased , and they had become indifferent about it . They wished themselves back again in the water , and after a month had passed they said it was much more beautiful down below , and pleasanter to be at home . Yet often , in the evening hours , the five sisters would twine their arms round each other , and rise to the surface , in a row . They had more beautiful voices than any human being could have ; and before the approach of a storm , and when they expected a ship would be lost , they swam before the vessel , and sang sweetly of the delights to be found in the depths of the sea , and begging the sailors not to fear if they sank to the bottom . But the sailors could not understand the song , they took it for the howling of the storm . And these things were never to be beautiful for them ; for if the ship sank , the men were drowned , and their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the Sea King . When the sisters rose , arm-in-arm , through the water in this way , their youngest sister would stand quite alone , looking after them , ready to cry , only that the mermaids have no tears , and therefore they suffer more . "" Oh , were I but fifteen years old , "" said she : "" I know that I shall love the world up there , and all the people who live in it . "" At last she reached her fifteenth year . "" Well , now , you are grown up , "" said the old dowager , her grandmother ; "" so you must let me adorn you like your other sisters ; "" and she placed a wreath of white lilies in her hair , and every flower leaf was half a pearl . Then the old lady ordered eight great oysters to attach themselves to the tail of the princess to show her high rank . "" But they hurt me so , "" said the little mermaid . "" Pride must suffer pain , "" replied the old lady . Oh , how gladly she would have shaken off all this grandeur , and laid aside the heavy wreath ! The red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better , but she could not help herself : so she said , "" Farewell , "" and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water . The sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves ; but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold , and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty . The sea was calm , and the air mild and fresh . A large ship , with three masts , lay becalmed on the water , with only one sail set ; for not a breeze stiffed , and the sailors sat idle on deck or amongst the rigging . There was music and song on board ; and , as darkness came on , a hundred colored lanterns were lighted , as if the flags of all nations waved in the air . The little mermaid swam close to the cabin windows ; and now and then , as the waves lifted her up , she could look in through clear glass window-panes , and see a number of well-dressed people within . Among them was a young prince , the most beautiful of all , with large black eyes ; he was sixteen years of age , and his birthday was being kept with much rejoicing . The sailors were dancing on deck , but when the prince came out of the cabin , more than a hundred rockets rose in the air , making it as bright as day . The little mermaid was so startled that she dived under water ; and when she again stretched out her head , it appeared as if all the stars of heaven were falling around her , she had never seen such fireworks before . Great suns spurted fire about , splendid fireflies flew into the blue air , and everything was reflected in the clear , calm sea beneath . The ship itself was so brightly illuminated that all the people , and even the smallest rope , could be distinctly and plainly seen . And how handsome the young prince looked , as he pressed the hands of all present and smiled at them , while the music resounded through the clear night air . It was very late ; yet the little mermaid could not take her eyes from the ship , or from the beautiful prince . The colored lanterns had been extinguished , no more rockets rose in the air , and the cannon had ceased firing ; but the sea became restless , and a moaning , grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves : still the little mermaid remained by the cabin window , rocking up and down on the water , which enabled her to look in . After a while , the sails were quickly unfurled , and the noble ship continued her passage ; but soon the waves rose higher , heavy clouds darkened the sky , and lightning appeared in the distance . A dreadful storm was approaching ; once more the sails were reefed , and the great ship pursued her flying course over the raging sea . The waves rose mountains high , as if they would have overtopped the mast ; but the ship dived like a swan between them , and then rose again on their lofty , foaming crests . To the little mermaid this appeared pleasant sport ; not so to the sailors . At length the ship groaned and creaked ; the thick planks gave way under the lashing of the sea as it broke over the deck ; the mainmast snapped asunder like a reed ; the ship lay over on her side ; and the water rushed in . The little mermaid now perceived that the crew were in danger ; even she herself was obliged to be careful to avoid the beams and planks of the wreck which lay scattered on the water . At one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a single object , but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene ; she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince ; when the ship parted , she had seen him sink into the deep waves , and she was glad , for she thought he would now be with her ; and then she remembered that human beings could not live in the water , so that when he got down to her father's palace he would be quite dead . But he must not die . So she swam about among the beams and planks which strewed the surface of the sea , forgetting that they could crush her to pieces . Then she dived deeply under the dark waters , rising and falling with the waves , till at length she managed to reach the young prince , who was fast losing the power of swimming in that stormy sea . His limbs were failing him , his beautiful eyes were closed , and he would have died had not the little mermaid come to his assistance . She held his head above the water , and let the waves drift them where they would . In the morning the storm had ceased ; but of the ship not a single fragment could be seen . The sun rose up red and glowing from the water , and its beams brought back the hue of health to the prince's cheeks ; but his eyes remained closed . The mermaid kissed his high , smooth forehead , and stroked back his wet hair ; he seemed to her like the marble statue in her little garden , and she kissed him again , and wished that he might live . Presently they came in sight of land ; she saw lofty blue mountains , on which the white snow rested as if a flock of swans were lying upon them . Near the coast were beautiful green forests , and close by stood a large building , whether a church or a convent she could not tell . Orange and citron trees grew in the garden , and before the door stood lofty palms . The sea here formed a little bay , in which the water was quite still , but very deep ; so she swam with the handsome prince to the beach , which was covered with fine , white sand , and there she laid him in the warm sunshine , taking care to raise his head higher than his body . Then bells sounded in the large white building , and a number of young girls came into the garden . The little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and placed herself between some high rocks that rose out of the water ; then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen , and watched to see what would become of the poor prince . She did not wait long before she saw a young girl approach the spot where he lay . She seemed frightened at first , but only for a moment ; then she fetched a number of people , and the mermaid saw that the prince came to life again , and smiled upon those who stood round him . But to her he sent no smile ; he knew not that she had saved him . This made her very unhappy , and when he was led away into the great building , she dived down sorrowfully into the water , and returned to her father's castle . She had always been silent and thoughtful , and now she was more so than ever . Her sisters asked her what she had seen during her first visit to the surface of the water ; but she would tell them nothing . Many an evening and morning did she rise to the place where she had left the prince . She saw the fruits in the garden ripen till they were gathered , the snow on the tops of the mountains melt away ; but she never saw the prince , and therefore she returned home , always more sorrowful than before . It was her only comfort to sit in her own little garden , and fling her arm round the beautiful marble statue which was like the prince ; but she gave up tending her flowers , and they grew in wild confusion over the paths , twining their long leaves and stems round the branches of the trees , so that the whole place became dark and gloomy . At length she could bear it no longer , and told one of her sisters all about it . Then the others heard the secret , and very soon it became known to two mermaids whose intimate friend happened to know who the prince was . She had also seen the festival on board ship , and she told them where the prince came from , and where his palace stood . "" Come , little sister , "" said the other princesses ; then they entwined their arms and rose up in a long row to the surface of the water , close by the spot where they knew the prince's palace stood . It was built of bright yellow shining stone , with long flights of marble steps , one of which reached quite down to the sea . Splendid gilded cupolas rose over the roof , and between the pillars that surrounded the whole building stood life-like statues of marble . Through the clear crystal of the lofty windows could be seen noble rooms , with costly silk curtains and hangings of tapestry ; while the walls were covered with beautiful paintings which were a pleasure to look at . In the centre of the largest saloon a fountain threw its sparkling jets high up into the glass cupola of the ceiling , through which the sun shone down upon the water and upon the beautiful plants growing round the basin of the fountain . Now that she knew where he lived , she spent many an evening and many a night on the water near the palace . She would swim much nearer the shore than any of the others ventured to do ; indeed once she went quite up the narrow channel under the marble balcony , which threw a broad shadow on the water . Here she would sit and watch the young prince , who thought himself quite alone in the bright moonlight . She saw him many times of an evening sailing in a pleasant boat , with music playing and flags waving . She peeped out from among the green rushes , and if the wind caught her long silvery-white veil , those who saw it believed it to be a swan , spreading out its wings . On many a night , too , when the fishermen , with their torches , were out at sea , she heard them relate so many good things about the doings of the young prince , that she was glad she had saved his life when he had been tossed about half-dead on the waves . And she remembered that his head had rested on her bosom , and how heartily she had kissed him ; but he knew nothing of all this , and could not even dream of her . She grew more and more fond of human beings , and wished more and more to be able to wander about with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her own . They could fly over the sea in ships , and mount the high hills which were far above the clouds ; and the lands they possessed , their woods and their fields , stretched far away beyond the reach of her sight . There was so much that she wished to know , and her sisters were unable to answer all her questions . Then she applied to her old grandmother , who knew all about the upper world , which she very rightly called the lands above the sea . "" If human beings are not drowned , "" asked the little mermaid , "" can they live forever ? do they never die as we do here in the sea ? "" "" Yes , "" replied the old lady , "" they must also die , and their term of life is even shorter than ours . We sometimes live to three hundred years , but when we cease to exist here we only become the foam on the surface of the water , and we have not even a grave down here of those we love . We have not immortal souls , we shall never live again ; but , like the green sea-weed , when once it has been cut off , we can never flourish more . Human beings , on the contrary , have a soul which lives forever , lives after the body has been turned to dust . It rises up through the clear , pure air beyond the glittering stars . As we rise out of the water , and behold all the land of the earth , so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see . "" "" Why have not we an immortal soul ? "" asked the little mermaid mournfully ; "" I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live , to be a human being only for one day , and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars . "" "" You must not think of that , "" said the old woman ; "" we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings . "" "" So I shall die , "" said the little mermaid , "" and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves , or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun . Is there anything I can do to win an immortal soul ? "" "" No , "" said the old woman , "" unless a man were to love you so much that you were more to him than his father or mother ; and if all his thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you , and the priest placed his right hand in yours , and he promised to be true to you here and hereafter , then his soul would glide into your body and you would obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind . He would give a soul to you and retain his own as well ; but this can never happen . Your fish's tail , which amongst us is considered so beautiful , is thought on earth to be quite ugly ; they do not know any better , and they think it necessary to have two stout props , which they call legs , in order to be handsome . "" Then the little mermaid sighed , and looked sorrowfully at her fish's tail . "" Let us be happy , "" said the old lady , "" and dart and spring about during the three hundred years that we have to live , which is really quite long enough ; after that we can rest ourselves all the better . This evening we are going to have a court ball . "" It is one of those splendid sights which we can never see on earth . The walls and the ceiling of the large ball-room were of thick , but transparent crystal . May hundreds of colossal shells , some of a deep red , others of a grass green , stood on each side in rows , with blue fire in them , which lighted up the whole saloon , and shone through the walls , so that the sea was also illuminated . Innumerable fishes , great and small , swam past the crystal walls ; on some of them the scales glowed with a purple brilliancy , and on others they shone like silver and gold . Through the halls flowed a broad stream , and in it danced the mermen and the mermaids to the music of their own sweet singing . No one on earth has such a lovely voice as theirs . The little mermaid sang more sweetly than them all . The whole court applauded her with hands and tails ; and for a moment her heart felt quite gay , for she knew she had the loveliest voice of any on earth or in the sea . But she soon thought again of the world above her , for she could not forget the charming prince , nor her sorrow that she had not an immortal soul like his ; therefore she crept away silently out of her father's palace , and while everything within was gladness and song , she sat in her own little garden sorrowful and alone . Then she heard the bugle sounding through the water , and thought – "" He is certainly sailing above , he on whom my wishes depend , and in whose hands I should like to place the happiness of my life . I will venture all for him , and to win an immortal soul , while my sisters are dancing in my father's palace , I will go to the sea witch , of whom I have always been so much afraid , but she can give me counsel and help . "" And then the little mermaid went out from her garden , and took the road to the foaming whirlpools , behind which the sorceress lived . She had never been that way before : neither flowers nor grass grew there ; nothing but bare , gray , sandy ground stretched out to the whirlpool , where the water , like foaming mill-wheels , whirled round everything that it seized , and cast it into the fathomless deep . Through the midst of these crushing whirlpools the little mermaid was obliged to pass , to reach the dominions of the sea witch ; and also for a long distance the only road lay right across a quantity of warm , bubbling mire , called by the witch her turfmoor . Beyond this stood her house , in the centre of a strange forest , in which all the trees and flowers were polypi , half animals and half plants ; they looked like serpents with a hundred heads growing out of the ground . The branches were long slimy arms , with fingers like flexible worms , moving limb after limb from the root to the top . All that could be reached in the sea they seized upon , and held fast , so that it never escaped from their clutches . The little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw , that she stood still , and her heart beat with fear , and she was very nearly turning back ; but she thought of the prince , and of the human soul for which she longed , and her courage returned . She fastened her long flowing hair round her head , so that the polypi might not seize hold of it . She laid her hands together across her bosom , and then she darted forward as a fish shoots through the water , between the supple arms and fingers of the ugly polypi , which were stretched out on each side of her . She saw that each held in its grasp something it had seized with its numerous little arms , as if they were iron bands . The white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea , and had sunk down into the deep waters , skeletons of land animals , oars , rudders , and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms ; even a little mermaid , whom they had caught and strangled ; and this seemed the most shocking of all to the little princess . She now came to a space of marshy ground in the wood , where large , fat water-snakes were rolling in the mire , and showing their ugly , drab-colored bodies . In the midst of this spot stood a house , built with the bones of shipwrecked human beings . There sat the sea witch , allowing a toad to eat from her mouth , just as people sometimes feed a canary with a piece of sugar . She called the ugly water-snakes her little chickens , and allowed them to crawl all over her bosom . "" I know what you want , "" said the sea witch ; "" it is very stupid of you , but you shall have your way , and it will bring you to sorrow , my pretty princess . You want to get rid of your fish's tail , and to have two supports instead of it , like human beings on earth , so that the young prince may fall in love with you , and that you may have an immortal soul . "" And then the witch laughed so loud and disgustingly , that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground , and lay there wriggling about . "" You are but just in time , "" said the witch ; "" for after sunrise to-morrow I should not be able to help you till the end of another year . I will prepare a draught for you , with which you must swim to land tomorrow before sunrise , and sit down on the shore and drink it . Your tail will then disappear , and shrink up into what mankind calls legs , and you will feel great pain , as if a sword were passing through you . But all who see you will say that you are the prettiest little human being they ever saw . You will still have the same floating gracefulness of movement , and no dancer will ever tread so lightly ; but at every step you take it will feel as if you were treading upon sharp knives , and that the blood must flow . If you will bear all this , I will help you . "" "" Yes , I will , "" said the little princess in a trembling voice , as she thought of the prince and the immortal soul . "" But think again , "" said the witch ; "" for when once your shape has become like a human being , you can no more be a mermaid . You will never return through the water to your sisters , or to your father's palace again ; and if you do not win the love of the prince , so that he is willing to forget his father and mother for your sake , and to love you with his whole soul , and allow the priest to join your hands that you may be man and wife , then you will never have an immortal soul . The first morning after he marries another your heart will break , and you will become foam on the crest of the waves . "" "" I will do it , "" said the little mermaid , and she became pale as death . "" But I must be paid also , "" said the witch , "" and it is not a trifle that I ask . You have the sweetest voice of any who dwell here in the depths of the sea , and you believe that you will be able to charm the prince with it also , but this voice you must give to me ; the best thing you possess will I have for the price of my draught . My own blood must be mixed with it , that it may be as sharp as a two-edged sword . "" "" But if you take away my voice , "" said the little mermaid , "" what is left for me ? "" "" Your beautiful form , your graceful walk , and your expressive eyes ; surely with these you can enchain a man's heart . Well , have you lost your courage ? Put out your little tongue that I may cut it off as my payment ; then you shall have the powerful draught . "" "" It shall be , "" said the little mermaid . Then the witch placed her cauldron on the fire , to prepare the magic draught . "" Cleanliness is a good thing , "" said she , scouring the vessel with snakes , which she had tied together in a large knot ; then she pricked herself in the breast , and let the black blood drop into it . The steam that rose formed itself into such horrible shapes that no one could look at them without fear . Every moment the witch threw something else into the vessel , and when it began to boil , the sound was like the weeping of a crocodile . When at last the magic draught was ready , it looked like the clearest water . "" There it is for you , "" said the witch . Then she cut off the mermaid's tongue , so that she became dumb , and would never again speak or sing . "" If the polypi should seize hold of you as you return through the wood , "" said the witch , "" throw over them a few drops of the potion , and their fingers will be torn into a thousand pieces . "" But the little mermaid had no occasion to do this , for the polypi sprang back in terror when they caught sight of the glittering draught , which shone in her hand like a twinkling star . So she passed quickly through the wood and the marsh , and between the rushing whirlpools . She saw that in her father's palace the torches in the ballroom were extinguished , and all within asleep ; but she did not venture to go in to them , for now she was dumb and going to leave them forever , she felt as if her heart would break . She stole into the garden , took a flower from the flower-beds of each of her sisters , kissed her hand a thousand times towards the palace , and then rose up through the dark blue waters . The sun had not risen when she came in sight of the prince's palace , and approached the beautiful marble steps , but the moon shone clear and bright . Then the little mermaid drank the magic draught , and it seemed as if a two-edged sword went through her delicate body : she fell into a swoon , and lay like one dead . When the sun arose and shone over the sea , she recovered , and felt a sharp pain ; but just before her stood the handsome young prince . He fixed his coal-black eyes upon her so earnestly that she cast down her own , and then became aware that her fish's tail was gone , and that she had as pretty a pair of white legs and tiny feet as any little maiden could have ; but she had no clothes , so she wrapped herself in her long , thick hair . The prince asked her who she was , and where she came from , and she looked at him mildly and sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes ; but she could not speak . Every step she took was as the witch had said it would be , she felt as if treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives ; but she bore it willingly , and stepped as lightly by the prince's side as a soap-bubble , so that he and all who saw her wondered at her graceful-swaying movements . She was very soon arrayed in costly robes of silk and muslin , and was the most beautiful creature in the palace ; but she was dumb , and could neither speak nor sing . Beautiful female slaves , dressed in silk and gold , stepped forward and sang before the prince and his royal parents : one sang better than all the others , and the prince clapped his hands and smiled at her . This was great sorrow to the little mermaid ; she knew how much more sweetly she herself could sing once , and she thought , "" Oh if he could only know that ! I have given away my voice forever , to be with him . "" The slaves next performed some pretty fairy-like dances , to the sound of beautiful music . Then the little mermaid raised her lovely white arms , stood on the tips of her toes , and glided over the floor , and danced as no one yet had been able to dance . At each moment her beauty became more revealed , and her expressive eyes appealed more directly to the heart than the songs of the slaves . Every one was enchanted , especially the prince , who called her his little foundling ; and she danced again quite readily , to please him , though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if she trod on sharp knives . The prince said she should remain with him always , and she received permission to sleep at his door , on a velvet cushion . He had a page's dress made for her , that she might accompany him on horseback . They rode together through the sweet-scented woods , where the green boughs touched their shoulders , and the little birds sang among the fresh leaves . She climbed with the prince to the tops of high mountains ; and although her tender feet bled so that even her steps were marked , she only laughed , and followed him till they could see the clouds beneath them looking like a flock of birds travelling to distant lands . While at the prince's palace , and when all the household were asleep , she would go and sit on the broad marble steps ; for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the cold sea-water ; and then she thought of all those below in the deep . Once during the night her sisters came up arm-in-arm , singing sorrowfully , as they floated on the water . She beckoned to them , and then they recognized her , and told her how she had grieved them . After that , they came to the same place every night ; and once she saw in the distance her old grandmother , who had not been to the surface of the sea for many years , and the old Sea King , her father , with his crown on his head . They stretched out their hands towards her , but they did not venture so near the land as her sisters did . As the days passed , she loved the prince more fondly , and he loved her as he would love a little child , but it never came into his head to make her his wife ; yet , unless he married her , she could not receive an immortal soul ; and , on the morning after his marriage with another , she would dissolve into the foam of the sea . "" Do you not love me the best of them all ? "" the eyes of the little mermaid seemed to say , when he took her in his arms , and kissed her fair forehead . "" Yes , you are dear to me , "" said the prince ; "" for you have the best heart , and you are the most devoted to me ; you are like a young maiden whom I once saw , but whom I shall never meet again . I was in a ship that was wrecked , and the waves cast me ashore near a holy temple , where several young maidens performed the service . The youngest of them found me on the shore , and saved my life . I saw her but twice , and she is the only one in the world whom I could love ; but you are like her , and you have almost driven her image out of my mind . She belongs to the holy temple , and my good fortune has sent you to me instead of her ; and we will never part . "" "" Ah , he knows not that it was I who saved his life , "" thought the little mermaid . "" I carried him over the sea to the wood where the temple stands : I sat beneath the foam , and watched till the human beings came to help him . I saw the pretty maiden that he loves better than he loves me ; "" and the mermaid sighed deeply , but she could not shed tears . "" He says the maiden belongs to the holy temple , therefore she will never return to the world . They will meet no more : while I am by his side , and see him every day . I will take care of him , and love him , and give up my life for his sake . "" Very soon it was said that the prince must marry , and that the beautiful daughter of a neighboring king would be his wife , for a fine ship was being fitted out . Although the prince gave out that he merely intended to pay a visit to the king , it was generally supposed that he really went to see his daughter . A great company were to go with him . The little mermaid smiled , and shook her head . She knew the prince's thoughts better than any of the others . "" I must travel , "" he had said to her ; "" I must see this beautiful princess ; my parents desire it ; but they will not oblige me to bring her home as my bride . I can not love her ; she is not like the beautiful maiden in the temple , whom you resemble . If I were forced to choose a bride , I would rather choose you , my dumb foundling , with those expressive eyes . "" And then he kissed her rosy mouth , played with her long waving hair , and laid his head on her heart , while she dreamed of human happiness and an immortal soul . "" You are not afraid of the sea , my dumb child , "" said he , as they stood on the deck of the noble ship which was to carry them to the country of the neighboring king . And then he told her of storm and of calm , of strange fishes in the deep beneath them , and of what the divers had seen there ; and she smiled at his descriptions , for she knew better than any one what wonders were at the bottom of the sea . In the moonlight , when all on board were asleep , excepting the man at the helm , who was steering , she sat on the deck , gazing down through the clear water . She thought she could distinguish her father's castle , and upon it her aged grandmother , with the silver crown on her head , looking through the rushing tide at the keel of the vessel . Then her sisters came up on the waves , and gazed at her mournfully , wringing their white hands . She beckoned to them , and smiled , and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was ; but the cabin-boy approached , and when her sisters dived down he thought it was only the foam of the sea which he saw . The next morning the ship sailed into the harbor of a beautiful town belonging to the king whom the prince was going to visit . The church bells were ringing , and from the high towers sounded a flourish of trumpets ; and soldiers , with flying colors and glittering bayonets , lined the rocks through which they passed . Every day was a festival ; balls and entertainments followed one another . But the princess had not yet appeared . People said that she was being brought up and educated in a religious house , where she was learning every royal virtue . At last she came . Then the little mermaid , who was very anxious to see whether she was really beautiful , was obliged to acknowledge that she had never seen a more perfect vision of beauty . Her skin was delicately fair , and beneath her long dark eye-lashes her laughing blue eyes shone with truth and purity . "" It was you , "" said the prince , "" who saved my life when I lay dead on the beach , "" and he folded his blushing bride in his arms . "" Oh , I am too happy , "" said he to the little mermaid ; "" my fondest hopes are all fulfilled . You will rejoice at my happiness ; for your devotion to me is great and sincere . "" The little mermaid kissed his hand , and felt as if her heart were already broken . His wedding morning would bring death to her , and she would change into the foam of the sea . All the church bells rung , and the heralds rode about the town proclaiming the betrothal . Perfumed oil was burning in costly silver lamps on every altar . The priests waved the censers , while the bride and bridegroom joined their hands and received the blessing of the bishop . The little mermaid , dressed in silk and gold , held up the bride's train ; but her ears heard nothing of the festive music , and her eyes saw not the holy ceremony ; she thought of the night of death which was coming to her , and of all she had lost in the world . On the same evening the bride and bridegroom went on board ship ; cannons were roaring , flags waving , and in the centre of the ship a costly tent of purple and gold had been erected . It contained elegant couches , for the reception of the bridal pair during the night . The ship , with swelling sails and a favorable wind , glided away smoothly and lightly over the calm sea . When it grew dark a number of colored lamps were lit , and the sailors danced merrily on the deck . The little mermaid could not help thinking of her first rising out of the sea , when she had seen similar festivities and joys ; and she joined in the dance , poised herself in the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey , and all present cheered her with wonder . She had never danced so elegantly before . Her tender feet felt as if cut with sharp knives , but she cared not for it ; a sharper pang had pierced through her heart . She knew this was the last evening she should ever see the prince , for whom she had forsaken her kindred and her home ; she had given up her beautiful voice , and suffered unheard-of pain daily for him , while he knew nothing of it . This was the last evening that she would breathe the same air with him , or gaze on the starry sky and the deep sea ; an eternal night , without a thought or a dream , awaited her : she had no soul and now she could never win one . All was joy and gayety on board ship till long after midnight ; she laughed and danced with the rest , while the thoughts of death were in her heart . The prince kissed his beautiful bride , while she played with his raven hair , till they went arm-in-arm to rest in the splendid tent . Then all became still on board the ship ; the helmsman , alone awake , stood at the helm . The little mermaid leaned her white arms on the edge of the vessel , and looked towards the east for the first blush of morning , for that first ray of dawn that would bring her death . She saw her sisters rising out of the flood : they were as pale as herself ; but their long beautiful hair waved no more in the wind , and had been cut off . "" We have given our hair to the witch , "" said they , "" to obtain help for you , that you may not die to-night . She has given us a knife : here it is , see it is very sharp . Before the sun rises you must plunge it into the heart of the prince ; when the warm blood falls upon your feet they will grow together again , and form into a fish's tail , and you will be once more a mermaid , and return to us to live out your three hundred years before you die and change into the salt sea foam . Haste , then ; he or you must die before sunrise . Our old grandmother moans so for you , that her white hair is falling off from sorrow , as ours fell under the witch's scissors . Kill the prince and come back ; hasten : do you not see the first red streaks in the sky ? In a few minutes the sun will rise , and you must die . "" And then they sighed deeply and mournfully , and sank down beneath the waves . The little mermaid drew back the crimson curtain of the tent , and beheld the fair bride with her head resting on the prince's breast . She bent down and kissed his fair brow , then looked at the sky on which the rosy dawn grew brighter and brighter ; then she glanced at the sharp knife , and again fixed her eyes on the prince , who whispered the name of his bride in his dreams . She was in his thoughts , and the knife trembled in the hand of the little mermaid : then she flung it far away from her into the waves ; the water turned red where it fell , and the drops that spurted up looked like blood . She cast one more lingering , half-fainting glance at the prince , and then threw herself from the ship into the sea , and thought her body was dissolving into foam . The sun rose above the waves , and his warm rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid , who did not feel as if she were dying . She saw the bright sun , and all around her floated hundreds of transparent beautiful beings ; she could see through them the white sails of the ship , and the red clouds in the sky ; their speech was melodious , but too ethereal to be heard by mortal ears , as they were also unseen by mortal eyes . The little mermaid perceived that she had a body like theirs , and that she continued to rise higher and higher out of the foam . "" Where am I ? "" asked she , and her voice sounded ethereal , as the voice of those who were with her ; no earthly music could imitate it . "" Among the daughters of the air , "" answered one of them . "" A mermaid has not an immortal soul , nor can she obtain one unless she wins the love of a human being . On the power of another hangs her eternal destiny . But the daughters of the air , although they do not possess an immortal soul , can , by their good deeds , procure one for themselves . We fly to warm countries , and cool the sultry air that destroys mankind with the pestilence . We carry the perfume of the flowers to spread health and restoration . After we have striven for three hundred years to all the good in our power , we receive an immortal soul and take part in the happiness of mankind . You , poor little mermaid , have tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing ; you have suffered and endured and raised yourself to the spirit-world by your good deeds ; and now , by striving for three hundred years in the same way , you may obtain an immortal soul . "" The little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the sun , and felt them , for the first time , filling with tears . On the ship , in which she had left the prince , there were life and noise ; she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her ; sorrowfully they gazed at the pearly foam , as if they knew she had thrown herself into the waves . Unseen she kissed the forehead of her bride , and fanned the prince , and then mounted with the other children of the air to a rosy cloud that floated through the aether . "" After three hundred years , thus shall we float into the kingdom of heaven , "" said she . "" And we may even get there sooner , "" whispered one of her companions . "" Unseen we can enter the houses of men , where there are children , and for every day on which we find a good child , who is the joy of his parents and deserves their love , our time of probation is shortened . The child does not know , when we fly through the room , that we smile with joy at his good conduct , for we can count one year less of our three hundred years . But when we see a naughty or a wicked child , we shed tears of sorrow , and for every tear a day is added to our time of trial ! "" </doc>

856,601,A22,"Posted on Mar 22nd , 2011 . 768 comments Wire to Wire : Inside the 1984 Detroit Tigers Championship Season is not my book . Though in a way it is . This other Wire to Wire , written by George Cantor and published in 2004 , chronicles the magical year when the Tigers opened the season with a 19-1 record . Imagine it happening day by day . 19 wins . One loss . A few weeks later they were 35-5 . During the first quarter of that season , the Tigers were virtually unbeatable . Argue great teams all you want , but based on that win-loss record , no team in baseball has ever been that good , before or since . The Tigers won the pennant and the World Series wire to wire that year – meaning they were in first place every day of the season . Only two other teams had ever done that in over 100 years of baseball . I took that as a freaking sign . I named my book after it . ( Cantor's book , I might add , had not been written yet . ) Later , I wrote to Jesse Burkhardt about my decision to quit my job and write a book . Jesse is also Iron Legs Burk , who showed me how to hop freights . He saved the letter for a decade or two , and today he mailed it back to me . To be clear , my Wire to Wire has nothing to do with baseball . The Tigers are n't even mentioned . ( Well , actually , there 's a little play by play in the background of one scene , an argument . If you read the book and you 're from Michigan , imagine the great Ernie Harwell calling the plays as Harp and Lane shout at each other . ) Stripped of the Tigers' connection , the phrase wire to wire had to find its own meaning in my story . And eventually it did . The necessity of discovering what it meant was a blessing I did n't recognize at first . Near the end of the letter , the younger me also writes this to Jesse : "" There 's a line in my book that says ' we rode the rails and we kept going long after most people would have quit . ' "" That particular line is no longer in the book – the voice is wrong – but now it seems to apply as much to writing as it did to riding . I kept going . The strength came from a lot of people , Jesse and many others . It came from music , my family , from random good luck that fell on me for no reason – and even from a baseball team that , during one amazing year , simply could n't lose . I 'm part way through Cantor's book , by the way , and if you 're a baseball fan , or a Sparky Anderson fan , I think you 'd enjoy it . I also have a new phrase in my head – a phrase that still needs to find its meaning . I 'm taking that as another good sign . In a world like this , you need a heart like Jon Dee Graham's . So you do n't get "" Faithless . "" 3 Posted by RobertoEr on April 26th , 2015 at 03 : 55 AM 4 Posted by Wiliabsopy on April 26th , 2015 at 05 : 37 AM clinical features . </doc>

747,1507,A12,"Service Provider Featured Article CloudBand Ecosystem Program Promotes Network Virtualization Network functions virtualization ( NFV ) has the potential to dramatically change the telecommunications industry and drive increased agility and efficiency . While the promise of a virtualized network infrastructure is great , it also has the potential to disrupt the business models of service providers and vendors that service the industry . Rather than run from NFV , however , Alcatel-Lucent ( News - Alert ) has gotten behind the revolution and launched a program to bring together vendors and service providers in a partnership to evolve the industry , known as the CloudBand Ecosystem Program . CloudBand is the market's first NFV platform , according to the company , both open and multivendor while being stringent enough to accommodate the strict needs of carriers . With the CloudBand Ecosystem Program , Alcatel-Lucent is making CloudBand available to the entire industry for free in a move to foster collaboration and experimentation that will accelerate adoption of NFV . This program will help service providers collaborate with each other and application vendors in a cloud partner ecosystem , accelerate NFV transformation through the leveraging of best-of-breed NFV vendors , and speed service deployment , according to the company . Some of the examples of what NFV can already do for the industry include CloudBand's virtual load balancer , authoritative domain and caching name service ( DNS ) , firewall , and session border controller ( SBC ) . "" In a cloud environment , a virtual network function such as a software-based virtual load balancer appliance is a basic , yet fundamental building block to integrate network services with application delivery , "" noted an Alcatel-Lucent case study . "" They can be rapidly provisioned on demand , when and where needed through self-service mechanisms , making them a very useful , simple and cost-effective tool to fully optimize application delivery . "" The continued rapid growth in DNS queries makes DNS another area ripe for virtualization . "" Given the critical role this infrastructure plays in ensuring customer experience and reducing churn , relying on legacy hardware with closed interfaces , poor scalability and inflexible provisioning mechanisms is no longer viable , "" according to the company . Virtual firewalls is a further area where NFV makes obvious sense , in that such firewalls can be rapidly deployed when and where needed independent of physical locations or boundaries , then stitched together with other virtual or physical network services though the network functions virtualization concept of service chaining . A fourth example given by Alcatel-Lucent is the SBC . The SBC is well suited to cloud deployment as it can be fully virtualized and deployed on a NFV such as CloudBand . "" Cloud deployment eliminates the need for closed , customized or proprietary hardware . The common , distributed infrastructure – with centralized management and orchestration – can be shared between many similar carrier-specific applications to achieve economies of scale , "" noted Alcatel-Lucent . These and other network functions can already be virtualized with CloudBand . With the CloudBand Ecosystem Program , the list will undoubtedly get longer . </doc>

The reaction provides a facile and practical synthesis of pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinolines . A number of pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinolines were synthesized in moderate to high yields ( up to 97 % ) . Pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinoline ( 1-4 ) ( Scheme 1a ) framework is ubiquitous in various natural products and some biologically active molecules . Representative compounds such as lamellarin D , lamellarin a 20-sulfate , and derivatives crispine A , trolline , and oleracein E are depicted in Scheme 1 . Among them , lamellarin D is a potent inhibitor of human topoisomerase I , ( 5 ) lamellarin a 20-sulfate is an inhibitor of HIV integrase , ( 6 ) and even other lamellarins exhibit anticancer activity ; ( 7-9 ) in addition , crispine A emerged as a target of great interest , due to potential biological and pharmaceutical activities . ( 10 , 11 ) The synthesis of pyrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinoline derivatives has been the focus of organic chemists' research for a long time . ( 12-18 ) Accordingly , a number of synthetic methods which include metal and metal-free catalysis have been reported . Sequential elegant studies ( Scheme 2 ) using metal catalysis ( e.g. , Ir , Ru , Rh , Ag , Cu , etc. ) were accomplished by several research groups . ( 19-27 ) Scheme 1 . Representative Natural Products Scheme 2 . Existing Strategies for the Synthesis of Pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinolines In recent years , metal-free catalysis has been of great interest in the construction of the pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinoline framework . These metal-free catalysis pathways involve stepwise coupling of radicals , which were in situ formed in the presence of t-BuOK / DMF , ( 28 ) or a concerted reaction followed by oxidation in the I2 / H2O2 , ( 29 ) KI / TBHP , ( 30 ) or TBAI / TBHP ( 31 ) system , such as [ 3 + 2 ] cycloaddition between 1 , 4-dicarbonyl-2-butenes and alkyl 2 - ( 3 , 4-dihydroisoquinolin-2 ( 1H ) - yl ) acetates . Although aforementioned successful synthetic methods have been developed , new and facile approaches are still desirable in terms of great structural diversity of pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinoline derivatives . In this context , we developed a new and facile synthetic method for pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinolines which include an intermolecular cascade cyclization of substituted 3-aryl ( heteroaryl ) - 3-chloroacrylaldehydes and tetrahydroisoquinolines in a one-pot reaction promoted by Et3N / DMF . Initially , the optimal reaction conditions in Yan's work ( 28 ) were also used to examine the reaction of ( Z ) - 3-chloro-3-phenylacrylaldehyde ( 1a ) with THIQ ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4-tetrahydroisoquinoline , 2a ) . Unfortunately , 3-phenyl-5 , 6-dihydropyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinoline ( 4a ) has not been detected , and the substrate 1a was transformed to complex byproducts ( Table 1 , entry 1 ) . Surprisingly , reducing the basicity of inorganic bases is beneficial to the reaction ; for example , when NaOH or K2CO3 was used as the base , the product 4a was obtained in 34 % and 42 % isolated yields respectively ( entries 2 and 3 ) , and 4a was confirmed by crystal structure ( CCDC : 1421171 ; ( 32 ) for more details please see Supporting Information ) . Encouraged by these preliminary results , a variety of organic bases such as DBU ( 1 , 8-diazabicyclo [ 5 . 4 . 0 ] undec-7-ene ) , DABCO ( 1 , 4-diazabicyclo [ 2 . 2 . 2 ] octane ) , DIPEA ( N , N-diisopropylethylamine ) , DMAP ( 4-dimethylaminopyridine ) , TMEDA ( tetramethylethylenediamine ) , and TEA ( trimethylamine ) were used instead of K2CO3 . Obviously , among these bases , TEA gave the best yield ( 56 % , entry 4 ) , and remarkably , DMAP gave us an extreme decrease in yield ( 26 % , entry 8 ) , which might due to DMAP being a weak nucleophile but a strong base . ( 33 ) Thus , we used TEA as the optimal base for further optimization including in the screening of solvents , reaction temperature , additives , and the loading of substrates . As results show in Table 1 , compared with DMF , the high polarity of solvents such as DMSO was also beneficial to the reaction ( 48 % , entry 10 ) ; however , compared with DMF or DMSO , other solvents of relatively low polarity , such as , CH2Cl2 , THF , and CH3CN ( entries 11 , 12 , and 13 ) , gave a trace amount of product 4a . The results showed that the reaction temperature has an apparent effect on the reaction ; both a lower and higher temperature would depress the conversion of substrates ( entries 14 and 15 ) . In addition , some additives such as activated 4 Å molecular sieves and silica or the oxidant MnO2 could not apparently improve the yields ( separately 55 % , 55 % , entries 16 , 17 , and 18 ) ; Gratifyingly , increasing the amount of THIQ and TEA led to a high yield ( 93 % , entry 19 ; for more details , see SI Table 1 ) ; Further experiments exhibited that oxygen had no impact on this reaction in which a radical pathway might not be involved . Ultimately , the optimal reaction conditions identified were as follows : 2.5 equiv of TEA , 4 equiv of THIQ , DMF used as solvent , and a reaction temperature of 120 ° C. Table 1 .

With optimized conditions in hand ( Table 1 , entry 20 ) , we next explored the scope and limitations of this reaction by employing various ( Z ) - 3-aryl ( heteroaryl ) - 3-chloroacrylaldehydes 1 and THIQs 2 ( Scheme 2 ) . An assembly of 20 compounds were synthesized using this protocol and gave the best yield up to 97 % . The results indicated that compounds 1 with electron-withdrawing ( F , Cl , Br , and NO2 ) or electron-donating groups ( Me and OMe ) were well tolerated and provided the corresponding products in moderate to high yields . As shown in Table 2 , when R1 is a meta - or para-substituted group on the phenyl ring , the corresponding product was obtained in a high yield ( up to 97 % , 4e ) . However , ortho-substituents such as F and Br due to their steric hindrance are not beneficial to the reaction ( 34 % 4g and 43 % 4k ) ; surprisingly the substrate which involves ortho-substituent OMe gave a satisfying yield of 71 % ( 4b ) . Substrates with the substituent R2 such as Me and phenyl all provided corresponding products in good to excellent yields respectively ( 84 % 4o and 61 % 4q ) . Table 2 . Scope of Tandem Reactiona Table aReaction conditions : 1a ( 1 . 20 mmol ) , 2a ( 4 . 80 mmol ) , 3a ( 3 . 00 mmol ) , solvent ( 3 mL ) , at 120 ° C 16 h , without Ar protection . Similarly , 1-chloro-3 , 4-dihydronaphthalene-2-carbaldehyde also gave corresponding product 4p in 41 % yield . Subsequently , when condensed 3-aryl - and 3-heteroaryl-substituted 3-chloroacrylaldehydes including naphthalene and thiophene frameworks were subjected to the optimized conditions , products 4r and 4s were obtained in excellent isolated yields ( 89 % and 95 % ) . Finally , 6 , 7-dimethoxy-1 , 2 , 3 , 4-tetrahydroisoquinoline in place of THIQ reacted with 1a ; this reaction also led to the corresponding product 4t in a satisfactory yield ( 77 % ) . Unfortunately , while N-methylbenzylamine and piperidine were used , corresponding products were not detected . To gain insight into the reaction mechanism we performed some additional experiments ( Scheme 3 ) . In experiment A , a mixture of Z and E isomers of 3-chloro-3 - ( 2-fluorophenyl ) acrylaldehyde ( 1gg , Z / E = 1.5 : 1 detected by 1H NMR see SI ) in place of 1g was used to investigate the effect of the E / Z configuration on the reaction . Interestingly , product 4g was obtained in 34 % yield ( Scheme 3A ) . The result is similar to the data for 4g which derived from ( Z ) - 3-chloro-3 - ( 2-fluorophenyl ) acrylaldehyde ( 1g ) used as the substrate in Table 2 and showed that the geometric configuration might have no effect on the reaction result . Compared with ( Z ) - 3-chloro-3-phenylacrylaldehyde ( 1a ) , ( Z ) - 3-bromo-3-phenylacrylaldehyde ( 1aa ) also might undergo the same intermediate step in this protocol and give 4a in a similarly high yield ( 92 % , Scheme 3B ) . In Yan's work , ( 28 ) intramolecular dehydrative coupling of tertiary amines and ketones was promoted by t-BuOK / DMF through a radical process ; ( 34 ) however , under the same conditions , the reaction of ( Z ) - 3-chloro-3-phenylacrylaldehyde ( 1a ) with tetrahydroisoquinoline could not afford corresponding product 4a ( Table 1 , entry 1 ) . In addition , another investigation using TEMPO to catch a possible radical intermediate under an argon atmosphere was not successful , and the product was still obtained in a high yield ( 90 % , Scheme 3C ) . Scheme 3 . Mechanistic Studies Thus , based on these experiment results , a plausible mechanism for this reaction is tentatively proposed in Scheme 4 . Initially , intermediate A was first formed from compounds 1 and 2 via a Michael addition , then nucleophilic substitution between A and THIQ gave an intermediate B under basic conditions . B prompted by TEA was transformed to intermediate C in situ , and then D was generated by 6π-electrocyclization and subsequent elimination of THIQ ( path a ) . Through path b , A was first prompted by TEA to give intermediate E , and then F might be formed through a nucleophilic addition . Final product 4 was generated after the dehydration of F. Scheme 4 . Suggested Mechanism In conclusion , we have developed a new TEA-prompted intermolecular cascade cyclization reaction of substituted 3-aryl ( heteroaryl ) - 3-chloroacrylaldehydes and tetrahydroisoquinolines in one pot . The reaction provides a facile and practical synthesis of pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinolines . A number of pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinolines were synthesized in moderate to high yields , and the mechanism of the reaction was tentatively proposed . </doc>

385,174,A14,"So I want to talk today about an idea . It 's a big idea . Actually , I think it 'll eventually be seen as probably the single biggest idea that 's emerged in the past century . It 's the idea of computation . Now , of course , that idea has brought us all of the computer technology we have today and so on . But there 's actually a lot more to computation than that . It 's really a very deep , very powerful , very fundamental idea , whose effects we 've only just begun to see . Well , I myself have spent the past 30 years of my life working on three large projects that really try to take the idea of computation seriously . So I started off at a young age as a physicist using computers as tools . Then , I started sort of drilling down , thinking about the computations I might want to do , trying to figure out what primitives they could be built up from and how they could be automated as much as possible . Eventually , I created a whole structure based on symbolic programming and so on that let me build Mathematica . And for the past 23 years , at an increasing rate , we 've been pouring more and more ideas and capabilities and so on into Mathematica , and I 'm happy to say that 's led to many good things in R and D and education , lots of other areas . Well , I have to admit , actually , that I also had a very selfish reason for building Mathematica . I wanted to use it myself , a bit like Galileo got to use his telescope 400 years ago . But I wanted to look , not at the astronomical universe , but at the computational universe . So we normally think of programs as being complicated things that we build for very specific purposes . But what about the space of all possible programs ? Here 's a representation of a really simple program . So , if we run this program , this is what we get . Very simple . So let 's try changing the rule for this program a little bit . Now we get another result , still very simple . Try changing it again . You get something a little bit more complicated , but if we keep running this for awhile , we find out that , although the pattern we get is very intricate , it has a very regular structure . So the question is : Can anything else happen ? Well , we can do a little experiment . Let's just do a little mathematical experiment , try and find out . Let 's just run all possible programs of the particular type that we 're looking at . They 're called cellular automata . You can see a lot of diversity in the behavior here . Most of them do very simple things . But if you look along all these different pictures , at rule number 30 , you start to see something interesting going on . So let 's take a closer look at rule number 30 here . So here it is . We 're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here , but we 're getting all this amazing stuff . It 's not at all what we 're used to , and I must say that , when I first saw this , it came as a huge shock to my intuition , and , in fact , to understand it , I eventually had to create a whole new kind of science . ( Laughter ) This science is different , more general , than the mathematics-based science that we 've had for the past 300 or so years . You know , it 's always seemed like a big mystery how nature , seemingly so effortlessly manages to produce so much that seems to us so complex . Well , I think we 've found its secret . It 's just sampling what 's out there in the computational universe and quite often getting things like Rule 30 or like this . And knowing that , starts to explain a lot of long-standing mysteries in science . It also brings up new issues though , like computational irreducibility . I mean , we 're used to having science let us predict things , but something like this is fundamentally irreducible . The only way to find its outcome is , effectively , just to watch it evolve . It 's connected to , what I call , the principle of computational equivalence , which tells us that even incredibly simple systems can do computations as sophisticated as anything . It does n ' t take lots of technology or biological evolution to be able to do arbitrary computation , just something that happens , naturally , all over the place . Things with rules as simple as these can do it . Well , this has deep implications about the limits of science , about predictability and controllability of things like biological processes or economies , about intelligence in the universe , about questions like free will and about creating technology . You know , working on this science for many years , I kept wondering , "" What will be its first killer app ? "" Well , ever since I was a kid , I 'd been thinking about systematizing knowledge and somehow making it computable . People like Leibniz had wondered about that too 300 years earlier . But I 'd always assumed that to make progress , I 'd essentially have to replicate a whole brain . Well , now I got to thinking : This scientific paradigm of mine suggests something different . And , by the way , I 've now got huge computation capabilities in Mathematica , and I 'm a CEO with some worldly resources to do large , seemingly crazy , projects . So I decided to just try to see how much of the systematic knowledge that 's out there in the world we can make computable . So , it 's been a big , very complex project , which I was not sure was going to work at all . But I 'm happy to say that it 's actually going really well . And last year we were able to release the first website version of Wolfram Alpha . It 's purpose is to be a serious knowledge engine that computes answers to questions . So let 's give it a try . Let 's start off with something really easy . Hope for the best . Very good . Okay . So far so good . ( Laughter ) Let 's try something a little bit harder . Let's say ... Let 's do some mathy thing and with luck it 'll work out the answer and try and tell us some interesting things things about related math . We could ask it something about the real world . Let's say -- I do n't know -- What 's the GDP of Spain ? And it should be able to tell us that . Now we could compute something related to this , let 's say the GDP of Spain divided by , I do n't know , the -- hmmm ... let 's say the revenue of Microsoft . ( Laughter ) The idea is that we can sort of just type this in , this kind of question in however we think of it . So let 's try asking a question , like a health related question . So let 's say we have a lab finding that -- you know , we have an LDL level of 140 for a male aged 50 . So let's type that in , and now Wolfram Alpha will go and use available public health data and try to figure out what part of the population that corresponds to and so on . Or let 's try asking about , I do n't know , the international space station . And what 's happening here is that Wolfram Alpha is not just looking up something ; it 's computing , in real time , where the international space station is right now , at this moment , how fast it 's going and so on . So Wolfram Alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things . It 's got by now , pretty good coverage of everything you might find in a standard reference library and so on . But the goal is to go much further and , very broadly , to democratize all of this kind of knowledge , and to try and be an authoritative source in all areas , to be able to compute answers to specific questions that people have , not by searching what other people may have written down before , but by using built in knowledge to compute fresh new answers to specific question . Now , of course , Wolfram Alpha is a monumentally huge , long term project with lots and lots of challenges . For a start , one has to curate a zillion different sources of facts and data , and we built quite a pipeline of Mathematica automation and human domain experts for doing this . But that 's just the beginning . Given raw facts or data to actually answer questions , one has to compute , one has to implement all those methods and models and algorithms and so on that science and other areas have built up over the centuries . Well , even starting from Mathematica , this is still a huge amount of work . So far , there are about 8 million lines of Mathematica code in Wolfram Alpha built by experts from many , many different fields . Well , a crucial idea of Wolfram Alpha is that you can just ask it questions using ordinary human language , which means that we 've got to be able to take all those strange utterances that people type into the input field and understand them . And I must say that I thought that step might just be plain impossible . Two big things happened . First , a bunch of new ideas about linguistics that came from studying the computational universe . And second , the realization that having actual computable knowledge completely changes how one can set about understanding language . And , of course , now with Wolfram Alpha actually out in the wild , we can learn from its actual usage . And , in fact , there 's been an interesting coevolution that 's been going on between Wolfram Alpha and its human users . And it 's really encouraging . Right now , if we look at web queries , more than 80 percent of them get handled successfully the first time . And if you look at things like the iPhone app , the fraction is considerably larger . So , I 'm pretty pleased with it all . But , in many ways , we 're still at the very beginning with Wolfram Alpha . I mean , everything is scaling up very nicely . We 're getting more confident . You can expect to see Wolfram Alpha technology showing up in more and more places , working both with this kind of public data , like on the website , and with private knowledge for people and companies and so on . You know , I 've realized that Wolfram Alpha actually gives one a sort of whole new kind of computing that one can call knowledge-based computing , in which one 's starting , not just from raw computation , but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge . And when one does that , one really changes the economics of delivering computational things , whether it 's on the web or elsewhere . You know , we have a fairly interesting situation right now . On the one hand , we have Mathematica , with its sort of precise , formal language and a huge network of carefully designed capabilities able to get a lot done in just a few lines . Let me show you a couple of examples here . So here 's a trivial piece of Mathematica programming . Here 's something where we 're sort of integrating a bunch of different capabilities here . Here we 'll just create in this line a little user interface that allows us to do something fun there . If you go on , that 's a slightly more complicated program that 's now doing all sorts of algorithmic things and creating user interface and so on . But it 's something that 's very precise stuff . It 's a precise specification with a precise formal language that causes Mathematica to know what to do here . Well , then on the other hand , we have Wolfram Alpha , with all the sort of messiness of the world and human language and so on built into it . So what happens when you put these things together ? I think it 's actually rather wonderful . With Wolfram Alpha inside Mathematica , you can , for example , make precise programs that call on real-world data . Here 's a really simple example . You can also just sort of give vague input and then try and have Wolfram Alpha figure out what you 're talking about . Let 's try this here . But actually I think sort of the most exciting thing about this is that it really gives one the chance to democratize programming . I mean , anyone will be able to just sort of say what they want in plain language , then , the idea is , that Wolfram Alpha will be able to figure out what precise pieces of code can do what they 're asking for and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need to build up bigger and bigger , precise programs . So , sometimes , Wolfram Alpha will be able to do the whole thing immediately and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with . So here 's a big website where we 've been collecting lots of educational and other demonstrations about lots of kinds of things . So , I do n't know , I 'll show you one example , maybe here . This is just an example of one of these computable documents . This is probably a fairly small piece of Mathematica code that 's able to be run here . Okay . Let 's zoom out again . So , given our new kind of science , is there a general way to use it to make technology ? So , with physical materials , we 're used to kind of going around the world and discovering that particular materials are useful for particular technological purposes and so on . Well , it turns out , we can do very much the same kind of thing in the computational universe . There 's an inexhaustible supply of programs out there . The challenge is to see how to harness them for human purposes . Something like Rule 30 , for example , turns out to be a really good randomness generator . Other simple programs are good models for processes in the natural or social world . And , for example , Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica are actually now full of algorithms that we discovered by searching the computational universe . And , for example , this -- we go back here -- This has become surprisingly popular among composers finding musical forms by searching the computational universe . In a sense , we can use the computational universe to get mass customized creativity . I 'm hoping we can , for example , use that even to get Wolfram Alpha to routinely sort of do invention and discovery on the fly and to find all sorts of wonderful stuff that no engineer and no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with . Well , so , that leads to sort of an ultimate question . Could it be that someplace out there in the computational universe we might find our physical universe ? Perhaps there 's even some quite simple rule , some simple program for our universe . Well , the history of physics would have us believe that the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated . But in the computational universe we 've now seen how rules that are incredibly simple can produce incredibly rich and complex behavior . So could that be what 's going on with our whole universe ? If the rules for the universe are simple , it 's kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level , operating , for example , far below the level of space or time , which makes it hard to represent things . But in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid . Well , then the universe has to evolve by applying little rules that progressively update this network . And each possible rule , in a sense , corresponds to a candidate universe . Actually , I have n ' t shown these before , but here are a few of the candidate universes that I 've looked at . Some of these are hopeless universes , completely sterile , with other kinds of pathologies like no notion of space , no notion of time , no matter , other problems like that . But the exciting thing that I 've found in the last few years is that you actually do n't have to go very far in the computational universe before you start finding candidate universes that are n ' t obviously not our universe . Here 's the problem : Any serious candidate for our universe , is inevitably full of computational irreducibility , which means that it is irreducibly difficult to find out how it will really behave , and whether it matches our physical universe . A few years ago , I was pretty excited to discover that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules that successfully reproduce special relativity and even general relativity and gravitation and at least give hints of quantum mechanics . So , will we find the whole of physics ? I do n't know for sure . But I think at this point it 's sort of almost embarrassing not to at least try . Not an easy project . One has got to build a lot of technology . One 's got to build a structure that 's probably at least as deep as existing physics . And I 'm not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is . Build a team , open it up , offer prizes and so on . But I 'll tell you here today that I 'm committed to seeing this project done , to see if , within this decade , we can finally hold in our hands the rule for our universe and know where our universe lies in the space of all possible universes -- and be able to type into Wolfram Alpha "" the theory of the universe , "" and have it tell us . ( Laughter ) So I 've been working on the idea of computation now for more than 30 years , building tools and methods and turning sort of intellectual ideas into millions of lines of code and grist for server farms and so on . With every passing year , I realize how much more powerful the idea of computation really is . It 's taken us a long way already , but there 's so much more to come . From the foundations of science to the limits of technology to the very definition of the human condition , I think computation is destined to be the defining idea of our future . Thank you . ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : That was astonishing . Stay here . I 've got a question . ( Applause ) So , that was , fair to say , an astonishing talk . Are you able to say in a sentence or two how this type of thinking could integrate at some point to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of as the fundamental explanations of the universe ? Stephen Wolfram : Well , the parts of physics that we kind of know to be true , things like the standard model of physics . What I 'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics or it 's simply wrong . The things that people have tried to do in the last 25 years or so with string theory and so on have been an interesting exploration that has tried to get back to the standard model , but has n ' t quite gotten there . My guess is that some great simplifications of what I 'm doing may actually have considerable resonance with what 's been done in string theory , but that 's a complicated math thing that I do n't yet know how it 's going to work out . CA : Benoit Mandlebrot is in the audience . He has also shown how complexity can arise from a simple start . Does your work relate to his ? SW : I think so . I view Benoit Mandlebrot's work as kind of one of the founding contributions to this kind of area . Benoit has been particularly interested in nested patterns , in fractals and so on , where the structure is something that 's kind of tree-like , and where there 's sort of a big branch that makes little branches , and even smaller branches and so on . That 's kind of one of the ways that you get towards true complexity . I think things like the Rule 30 cellular automaton get us to a different level . In fact , in a very precise way they get us to a different level because they seem to be things that are capable of complexity that 's sort of as great as complexity can ever get ... I could go on about this at great length , but I wo n ' t . CA : Stephen Wolfram , thank you . ( Applause ) </content> </doc>

805,1142,A17,"Roland's System-8 keyboard is all the synths you want in one case The company may have just created your favorite synthesizer . There 's a reason professional keyboards and synths are filled with dials , buttons and levers . When a musician is getting ready for the next song , it 's quicker to turn a knob than sift through multiple submenus via the onboard computer . Roland's System-8 synth has such a display , but nearly everything you need is at your fingertips , and that 's great . Gallery : Roland System-8 review | 15 Photos The System-8 continues the company's reputation for aggressively priced drum machines and keyboards modeled after vintage instruments . It even has the same design aesthetic as the Aira family of products that kicked off this nostalgia trend . But do n't let those cartoonish glowing green lights distract you from the fact that this is a synth with a ton of features at a great value . The main draw of the $ 1 , 500 System-8 is Roland's "" Plug-Out "" feature . With it , musicians can add the patches and sounds of old-school synths to the keyboard on the fly . And not just one instrument , either -- three additional Plug-Out synths can be added at a time for quick access via onboard buttons . The sequencer , which on other instruments can be difficult to use , can be ready to record with just a tap . Sequencing a keyboard run is simple . Even when you have to use the onboard display to adjust features like the length of a sequence , it does n't require a 45-minute dive into the owner's manual . The synthesizer's push-button "" Performance "" mode ( aka keyboard split , where the high and low-end of the keyboard are split between two different patches ) is also just a button-press away . Plus , it can have sounds from two separate Plug-Out synths on it . As a bonus , you can create a sequence for each of those patches . You can even throw in an arpeggiator for good measure , all with a few taps . In fact , that 's the wonderful thing about the eight-voice polyphonic System-8 : All the major features are just a tap , twist or slide away . No need to delve into menus and submenus . Touchscreens transformed computing . Without them , we 'd still be carrying music players with scroll wheels . But in many instances , they 're not a good substitute for physical buttons . ( I 'm looking at you , automakers . ) Of course , having all those features placed on the top of an instrument could be a confusing mess . Yet Roland has been able to tame the forest of inputs with labeling and placement that make it a snap to change the wave of oscillator one while reducing the volume of oscillator two . The layout is straightforward , with the arpeggiator on the far left ; the oscillators , LFO and associated controls in the middle ; and the sequencer and filters on the right . After about five minutes of playing , I knew exactly where to place my hands to adjust the sounds . And if you 're worried about those noises , do n't be . While analog purists might be turned off by the digital System-8 , they 'll be hard-pressed to detect the difference between the plug-out Jupiter 8 and the real thing without them playing side by side . So with a clean , knob-and-button-friendly layout and audio that 'll impress even hardcore analog purists , the System-8 is a winner . But it wo n't be ideal for everyone . First off , the green-glowing lights are likely to be a turnoff for some . I own the Roland Aira TR8 , so I 've gotten used to it . Fortunately , during my tests , I found that those jade-colored illuminations wo n't blind you when the lights are down . The last thing you want on stage is something so bright , you ca n't even see it . That is , if you feel comfortable dragging the System-8 to gigs . Some might be wary of playing live with the System-8 because of its plastic case . If you plan on using this in your home or practice space , it should n't be an issue . But if you want to use it on stage and you play a lot of shows , it could be a problem . You can get a hard case for transportation , but Roland could have gone the extra mile to make the keyboard more robust if it was going to pack it full of features . I would gladly throw the company an extra $ 150 for a metal or wood case , and I 'm sure others would as well . That 's not to say that a plastic case is a recipe for disaster , though . My band has been using a synth on stage with a plastic case for nearly six years without issue . Then again , when it was new it cost about a third of the price of the System-8 . Still , the System-8 is an incredible value at $ 1 , 500 -- and it should remind other keyboard makers that it 's not just professional-grade products that could use some good old-fashioned knobs to make their instruments easier to use . If you 're looking to step up your at-home productions or you 're willing to be extra careful while gigging , it 'll be a great addition to your synth arsenal .

Your login will bring you to the Reseller home page in HELM and we advise that you click around to get used to the interface . In order to set up domains in your new reseller package you should first configure your account . You will need to create your hosting plans first . You can then create user accounts and assign a plan to a user . A plan governs the amount of features and resources you will allow a user to utilise . When you create a user , you will assign one of the plans you have created as a package for that user . This package can then be left as it is , or it can be modified to an exact requirement . Once you have created a package for that user , you can then add a domain under that users account . A user can have more than one domain if you allow them . Lets jump right in with a video tutorial , showing you how to create your first hosting plan in your new reseller account . Creating your plans ( 443KB ) It is important to note here that you do not have to set up a hosting plan every time you need to create a website . Now you should have at least one plan created in your reseller package you can go ahead and create a new user . At least one user is required before you are able to add a domain to your account . The user is assigned a username and password which is required for access to the domain control panel . If you are giving your customers access to the control panel then you will need to create a user for each client you have .

Small angle X-ray scattering reveals changes of bone mineral habit and size in archaeological bone samples . ( 2000 ) Fibre Diffraction Review 9 36-43 X-ray scattering provides a powerful non-destructive technique capable of providing important information about the size , habit and arrangement of mineral crystals in bone . In the case of archaeological bone the changes in the habit of the apatite crystals and recrystallised material may reflect the changes in bone environment that have occurred since death . In the study presented here we have examined a variety of archaeological bones by small-angle X-ray scattering to show the alterations in bone habit that can be adopted after ' diagenetic remodelling ' . Furthermore we show that the use of small-angle scattering microfocus technology allows us to probe into the fine structure alterations that can occur in bone as a result of microbial attack and mineral recrystallisation . The integrity of the bone crystallites has a strong correlation with the ability to extract other biomolecules from bone such as osteocalcin and DNA . Alterations in the crystallite habit may explain the success of macromolecule recovery from archaeological samples . </doc>

1238,1099,A16,"Human Rights Act 1998 An Act to give further effect to rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights ; to make provision with respect to holders of certain judicial offices who become judges of the European Court of Human Rights ; and for connected purposes . Sub-s ( 1 ) : in para ( c ) words "" Article 1 of the Thirteenth Protocol "" in square brackets substituted by SI 2004 / 1574 , art 2 ( 1 ) . Date in force : 22 June 2004 : see SI 2004 / 1574 , art 1 . Sub-s ( 4 ) : words "" Secretary of State "" in square brackets substituted by SI 2003 / 1887 , art 9 , Sch 2 , para 10 ( 1 ) . Date in force : 19 August 2003 : see SI 2003 / 1887 , art 1 ( 2 ) . Relates to Human Rights Act 1998 ( Amendment ) Order 2004 , SI 2004 / 1574 ( made under sub-s ( 4 )) . In particular , the Act makes it unlawful for any public body to act in a way which is incompatible with the Convention , unless the wording of any other primary legislation provides no other choice . It also requires the judiciary ( including tribunals ) to take account of any decisions , judgment or opinion of the European Court of Human Rights , and to interpret legislation , as far as possible , in a way which is compatible with Convention rights . However , if it is not possible to interpret an Act of Parliament so as to make it compatible with the Convention , the judges are not allowed to override it . All they can do is issue a declaration of incompatibility . This declaration does not affect the validity of the Act of Parliament : in that way , the Human Rights Act seeks to maintain the principle of Parliamentary sovereignty ( see : Constitution of the United Kingdom ) . However , judges may strike down secondary legislation . Under the Act , individuals retain the right to sue in the Strasbourg court . The Convention was drafted by the Council of Europe after World War II . Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe was the Chair of the Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions of the Council's Consultative Assembly from 1949 to 1952 , and oversaw the drafting of the European Convention on Human Rights . It was designed to incorporate a traditional civil liberties approach to securing "" effective political democracy "" , from the strong traditions of freedom and liberty in the United Kingdom . As a founding member of the Council of Europe , the UK acceded to the European Convention on Human Rights in March 1951 . However it was not until the 1960s that British citizens were able to bring claims in the European Court of Human Rights ( ECtHR ) . During the 1980s , groups such as Charter 88 ( which invoked the 300th anniversary of the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and the Bill of Rights 1689 ) accused the executive of misusing its power and argued that a new British Bill of Rights was needed to secure human rights in the UK . In its manifesto for the 1997 general election , the Labour party pledged to incorporate the European Convention into domestic law . When the election resulted in a landslide Labour victory , the party , under the leadership of Tony Blair , fulfilled this pledge through Parliamentary passage of the Human Rights Act the following year . The 1997 white paper "" Rights Brought Home "" [ 3 ] stated : It takes on average five years to get an action into the European Court of Human Rights once all domestic remedies have been exhausted ; and it costs an average of £ 30 , 000 . Bringing these rights home will mean that the British people will be able to argue for their rights in the British courts – without this inordinate delay and cost . The Human Rights Act places a duty on all courts and tribunals in the United Kingdom to interpret legislation so far as possible in a way compatible with the rights laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights ( section 3 ( 1 )) . Where this is not possible , the court may issue a "" declaration of incompatibility "" . The declaration does not invalidate the legislation , but permits the amendment of the legislation by a special fast-track procedure under section 10 of the Act . As of August 2006 , 20 declarations had been made , of which six were overturned on appeal . The Human Rights Act applies to all public bodies within the United Kingdom , including central government , local authorities , and bodies exercising public functions . However , it does not include Parliament when it is acting in its legislative capacities . Section 3 is a particularly wide provision that requires courts to interpret both primary and subordinate legislation so that their provisions are compatible with the articles of the European Convention of Human Rights which are also part of the Human Rights Act . [ 4 ] This interpretation goes far beyond normal statutory interpretation , [ 4 ] and includes past and future legislation , therefore preventing the Human Rights act from being impliedly repealed . [ 5 ] Courts have applied this through three forms of interpretation , "" reading in "" – inserting words where there are none in a statute ; "" reading out "" where words are omitted from a statute ; and "" reading down "" where a particular meaning is chosen to be in compliance . [ 6 ] They do not interpret statutes to conflict with legislative intent , and courts have been reluctant in particular to "" read out "" provisions for this reason . If it is not possible to so interpret , they may issue a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 . [ 7 ] Section 9 limits the right to claim against judicial acts made by the UK such that effectively a claim under the Act is possible only by exercising a right of appeal as set out by the Access to Justice Act 1999 Sections 4 and 10 allows courts to issue a declaration of incompatibility where it is impossible to use section 3 to interpret primary or subordinate legislation to be compatible with the articles of the European Convention of Human Rights , which are also part of the Human Rights Act . [ 8 ] In these cases , interpretation to comply may conflict with legislative intent . [ 9 ] It is considered a measure of last resort . A range of superior courts can issue a declaration of incompatibility . [ 8 ] A declaration of incompatibility is not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made , [ 8 ] nor can a declaration invalidate legislation . [ 10 ] Section 4 therefore achieves its aim through political rather than legal means . Section 10 gives a government minister the power to make a "" remedial order "" in response to either a declaration of incompatibility , from which there is no possibility of appeal , [ 11 ] or a ruling of the European Court of Human Rights A remedial order may "" make such amendments to the legislation as [ the Minister ] considers necessary to remove the incompatibility "" . [ 12 ] Remedial orders do not require full legislative approval , [ 10 ] but must be approved by resolutions of each House of Parliament . In especially urgent cases , Parliamentary approval may be retroactive . [ 13 ] Remedial orders may have retroactive effect , but no one may be guilty of a criminal offence solely as the result of the retroactive effect of a remedial order . [ 14 ] Section 10 has been used to make small adjustments to bring legislation into line with Convention rights although entirely new pieces of legislation are sometimes necessary . [ 15 ] As of December 2014 , 29 declarations of incompatibility have been issued , of which [ 16 ] 8 have been struck down on appeal 1 is pending appeal , as of December 2014 16 have been remedied through the ordinary legislative process ( including amendment or repeal of the offending legislation ) . 3 have been addressed through remedial orders 1 has not been remedied . The one case not to have been remedied , as of December 2014 , is Smith v. Scott , concerning the right of serving prisoners to vote in the UK . [ 16 ] Although the Act , by its own terms , applies only to public bodies , it has had increasing influence on private law litigation between individual citizens leading some academics to state that it has horizontal effect as well as vertical effect ( as in disputes between the state and citizens ) . This is because section 6 ( 1 ) of the Human Rights Act defines courts and tribunals as public bodies meaning their judgments must comply with human rights obligations except in cases of declarations of incompatibility . Therefore , judges have a duty to act in compatibility with the Convention even when an action is a private one between two citizens . Many rights established under the Human Rights Act 1998 were already protected under UK law ( such as freedom ) , but the purpose of the Act was largely to establish the European Convention of Human Rights in British law . This provision was not required by the European Convention ( protocol 6 permits the death penalty in time of war ; protocol 13 , which prohibits the death penalty for all circumstances , did not then exist ) ; rather , the government introduced it as a late amendment in response to parliamentary pressure . The Act provides that it is unlawful for a "" public authority "" to act in such a way as to contravene "" Convention rights "" . [ 17 ] For these purposes public authority includes any other person "" whose functions are functions of a public nature . "" [ 18 ] It also explicitly includes the Courts . [ 19 ] Convention rights includes only those rights specified in section 1 of the Act ( these are recited in full in Schedule 1 ) . [ 20 ] In the interpretation of those rights the Act provides that the domestic Courts "" may "" take into account the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights ( ECtHR ) . [ 21 ] Section 7 enables any person with standing ( as stipulated by Article 34 of the Convention ) to raise an action against a public authority which has acted or proposes to act in such a Convention-contravening manner . [ 22 ] This is a more rigorous standard than is ordinarily applied to standing in English , although not Scottish , judicial review . If it is held that the public authority has violated the claimant ' s Convention rights , then the Court is empowered to "" grant such relief or remedy , or make such order , within its powers as it considers just and appropriate . "" [ 23 ] This can include an award of damages , although the Act provides limitations on the Court's capacity to make such an award . [ 24 ] However , the Act also provides a defence for public authorities if their Convention violating act is in pursuance of a mandatory obligation imposed upon them by Westminster primary legislation . [ 25 ] The Act envisages that this will ordinarily be a difficult standard to meet though since it requires the Courts to read such legislation ( and for that matter subordinate legislation ) "" So far as it is possible to do so ... in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights . "" [ 26 ] Where it is impossible to read primary legislation in a Convention compliant manner , the only sanction available to the Courts is to make a Declaration of Incompatibility in respect of it . [ 27 ] The power to do so is restricted to the higher Courts . [ 28 ] Such a Declaration has no direct impact upon the continuing force of the legislation but it is likely to produce public pressure upon the government to remove the incompatibility . It also strengthens the case of a claimant armed with such a decision from the domestic Courts in any subsequent appeal to ECtHR . In order to provide swift compliance with the Convention the Act allows Ministers to take remedial action to amend even offending primary legislation via subordinate legislation . [ 29 ] Lee Clegg ' s murder conviction gave rise to the first case invoking the Act , brought by The Times in October 2000 which sought to overturn a libel ruling against the newspaper . Campbell v. MGN Ltd. [ 2002 ] EWCA Civ 1373 , Naomi Campbell and Sara Cox both sought to assert their right to privacy under the Act . Both cases were successful for the complainant ( Campbell's on the second attempt ; Cox's attempt was not judicially decided but an out of court settlement was reached before the issue could be tested in court ) and an amendment to British law to incorporate a provision for privacy is expected to be introduced . Venables and Thompson v. News Group Newspapers [ 2001 ] 1 All ER 908 , the James Bulger murder case tested whether the Article 8 ( privacy ) rights of Venables and Thomson , the convicted murderers of Bulger , applied when four newspapers sought to publish their new identities and whereabouts , using their Article 10 rights of freedom of expression . The judge , Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss , granted permanent global injunctions ordering that the material not be published because of the disastrous consequences such disclosure might have for the former convicts , not least the possibility of physical harm or death ( hence claims for Article 2 rights ( right to life ) were entertained , and sympathised with ) . R. v. Chauhan and Hollingsworth : Amesh Chauhan and Dean Hollingsworth were photographed by a speed camera in 2000 . As is standard practice for those caught in this way , they were sent a form by the police asking them to identify who was driving the vehicle at the time . They protested under the Human Rights Act , arguing that they could not be required to give evidence against themselves . An initial judgment , by Judge Peter Crawford at Birmingham Crown Court , ruled in their favour [ 30 ] but this was later reversed . The same issue came to light in Scotland with Procurator Fiscal v Brown [ 2000 ] UKPC D3 , [ 31 ] in which a woman , when apprehended on suspicion of theft of a bottle of gin , was drunk and was asked by police to identify who had been driving her car ( which was nearby ) at the time she arrived at the superstore . Price v. Leeds City Council [ 2005 ] : [ 32 ] On 16 March 2005 the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling that Leeds City Council could not infringe the right to a home of a Romani family , the Maloneys , by evicting them from public land . The court however referred the case to the House of Lords as this decision conflicted with a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights ( ECtHR ) . In March 2006 , [ citation needed ] the High Court in London ruled against a hospital's bid to turn off the ventilator that kept the child , known as Baby MB , alive . The 19-month-old baby has the genetic condition spinal muscular atrophy , which leads to almost total paralysis . The parents of the child fought for his right to life , despite claims from medics that the invasive ventilation would cause an ' intolerable life ' . Connors v. UK , [ 33 ] a judgment given by ECtHR , declared that travellers who had their licences to live on local authority-owned land suddenly revoked had been discriminated against , in comparison to the treatment of mobile-home owners who did not belong to the traveller population , and thus their Article 14 ( protection from discrimination ) and Article 8 ( right to respect for the home ) rights had been infringed . However , there has never been a case where the Act has been successfully invoked to allow travellers to remain on greenbelt land , and indeed the prospects of this ever happening seem highly unlikely after the House of Lords decision in Kay v Lambeth LBC which severely restricted the occasions on which Article 8 may be invoked to protect someone from eviction in the absence of some legal right over the land . Afghan hijackers case 2006 , in May 2006 , a politically controversial decision regarding the treatment of nine Afghan men who hijacked a plane to flee from the Taliban , caused widespread condemnation by many tabloid newspapers ( most notably The Sun ) , the broadsheets and the leaders of both the Labour Party and the Conservative Party . It was ruled by an Immigration Tribunal , under the Human Rights Act , that the hijackers could remain in the United Kingdom ; a subsequent court decision ruled that the government had abused its power in restricting the hijackers' right to work . During the campaign for the 2005 parliamentary elections the Conservatives under Baron Howard declared their intention to "" overhaul or scrap "" the Human Rights Act : The time had come to liberate the nation from the avalanche of political correctness , costly litigation , feeble justice , and culture of compensation running riot in Britain today and warning that the politically correct regime ushered in by Labour's enthusiastic adoption of human rights legislation has turned the age-old principle of fairness on its head "" . [ 34 ] The schoolboy arsonist allowed back into the classroom because enforcing discipline apparently denied his right to education ; the convicted rapist given £ 4000 compensation because his second appeal was delayed ; the burglar given taxpayers' money to sue the man whose house he broke into ; travellers who thumb their nose at the law allowed to stay on green belt sites they have occupied in defiance of planning laws "" . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] The schoolboy referred to by Mr Howard was suing for compensation , not to be allowed back into the classroom , since he was already a university student at the time of the court case . [ 37 ] In addition , the claim was rejected . [ 38 ] The Human Rights Act prior to its introduction , it would result in unelected judges making substantive judgments about government policies and "" legislating "" in their amendments to the common law resulting in a usurpation of Parliament's legislative supremacy and an expansion of the UK courts' justiciability . R ( on the application of Daly ) v Secretary of State for the Home Department highlights how the introduction of a proportionality test borrowed from ECtHR jurisprudence has allowed a greater scrutiny of the substantive merits of a government's policy , meaning that judicial review has become more of an appeal than a review . [ citation needed ] The interpretative obligation under section 3 ( 1 ) of the Human Rights Act to read primary legislation as Convention compliant , so far as is possible , is not dependent upon the presence of ambiguity in legislation . [ 39 ] Section 3 ( 1 ) could require the court to depart from the unambiguous meaning that legislation would otherwise bear subject to the constraint that this modified interpretation must be one "" possible "" interpretation of the legislation . [ 40 ] Paul Craig argues that this results in the courts adopting linguistically strained interpretations instead of issuing declarations of incompatibility . Rulings based on the Human rights Act have been criticised by Lady Hale . In 2011 she said that the Act was overused , and criticised the decision of European human rights judges to give prisoners the vote . [ 41 ] In 2008 , Paul Dacre ( as editor of the Daily Mail ) criticised the Human Rights Act for allowing , in effect , a right to privacy at English law despite the fact that Parliament has not passed such legislation . [ citation needed ] He was referring to the indirect horizontal effect of the Human Rights Act on the doctrine of breach of confidence which has moved English law closer towards a common law right to privacy . [ 42 ] In response , Baron Falconer ( as Lord Chancellor ) stated that the Human Rights Act had been passed by Parliament , that people's private lives needed protection and that the judge in the case had interpreted relevant authorities correctly . [ 43 ] In contrast , some have argued that the Human Rights Act does not give adequate protection to rights because of the ability for the government to derogate from Convention rights under article 15 . Recent cases such as R ( ProLife Alliance ) v. BBC [ 2002 ] EWCA Civ 297 have been decided in reference to common law rights rather than statutory rights leading to the possibility of judicial activism . [ 44 ] Senior Labour politicians have criticised the Human Rights Act and the willingness of the judiciary to invoke declarations on incompatibility against terrorism legislation . Baron Reid argued that the Human Rights Act was hampering the fight against global terrorism in regard to controversial control orders : There is a very serious threat – and I am the first to admit that the means we have of fighting it are so inadequate that we are fighting with one arm tied behind our backs . So I hope when we bring forward proposals in the next few weeks that we will have a little less party politics and a little more support for national security . [ 45 ] In 2007 , Howard's successor as Leader of the Opposition , David Cameron , vowed to repeal the Human Rights Act if he was elected , instead replacing it with a ' Bill of Rights ' for Britain . [ 46 ] The human rights organisation JUSTICE released a discussion paper entitled A Bill of Rights for Britain ? , examining the case for updating the Human Rights Act with an entrenched bill . [ 47 ] In 2011 , following controversial rulings from both the European Court of Human Rights ( ECtHR ) and the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom , David Cameron suggested a "" British Bill of Rights "" . [ 49 ] The government commission set up to investigate the case for a Bill of Rights had a split of opinion . [ 50 ] Judge Dean Spielmann , the President of ECtHR , warned in 2013 that the United Kingdom could not withdraw from the Convention on Human Rights without jeopardising its membership of the European Union . [ 51 ] In 2014 , the Conservative Party planned to repeal the Act and replace it with a "" British Bill of Rights "" . [ 52 ] Following the 2015 election win for the Conservative Party , Michael Gove , the Secretary of State for Justice , was charged with implementing the reforms which were previously blocked by the Liberal Democrats in the coalition government . [ 53 ] The Conservative Party manifesto said that the new bill will "" break the formal link between British Courts and the European Court of Human Rights "" . [ 54 ] This would mean that human rights cases under the ECtHR would have to go to a court in Strasbourg rather than being able to be tried in the UK . [ 55 ] Civil liberty advocates have expressed concern that the proposed changes would "" erode the right to life , the right to privacy , the right to a fair trial , the right to protest and the right to freedom from torture and discrimination "" .

See full bio Mitsubishi saves the best Lancer Evolution for last Roadshow Editors' Rating 6.2 Overall Performance 8 Features 5 Design 7 Media & Connectivity 4 The Good Mitsubishi gives a proper sendoff to the Lancer Evolution by making the Final Edition the most powerful and track-worthy production model ever . The Bad Away from the circuit , the Evolution remains difficult to live with on a daily basis , terrible on-road comfort and a dated cabin devoid of modern infotainment and safety tech . The Bottom Line Mitsubishi's Lancer Evolution is a throwback performance sedan best appreciated by hardcore enthusiasts . Mitsubishi saves the best Lancer Evolution for last The Final Edition sends the Evo out on a high note with more power and exclusive styling touches . by Jon Wong Close Drag I knew this day was coming . My last hurrah in a new Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution before it disappears from showrooms . The Japanese carmaker said this generation of the Evolution , its tenth , would be the last . For sport-compact car enthusiasts who thought that the announcement may have just been a cruel joke , the release of this special Final Edition model is proof positive that the end of Mitsubishi's rally-bred high-performance sedan has become reality . Losing the Evo bums me out even though I 've never been a huge fan of the current model . I love the Evolution IX for its emotion-rich drive character , gonzo performance and fitting boy-racer looks , yet in all my experiences with the Evo X -- mostly in MR trims with a not-so-great dual-clutch transmission -- it never quite spoke to me like its predecessor . Am I missing something about the Evo X ? I 'm using this last go with a five-speed-manual-equipped Final Edition to find out by taking it on a short road trip and to the race track . Maybe I 'll finally come to terms with this last Evo ? Or maybe I 'll still be disappointed and continue my casual search for good-condition Evo IX for my own garage . On-road brutality The drone from the drivetrain churning at 3,500 rpm in fifth gear on the expressway is headache inducing , explaining my florescent orange ear plugs as I head west across Michigan . Things like sound insulation and acoustic glass are n't always high on the requirements list for a no-nonsense performance car . Road , wind and drivetrain racket whirls constantly in the cabin making the 180-mile run to South Haven , Michigan , far from delightful . Turning up tunes on the six-speaker audio system to mask the unpleasant noises is one option . The 6 . 1-inch center infotainment touchscreen gives access to satellite radio and Bluetooth audio and phone streaming , but not much else . There 's no navigation , Apple CarPlay or Android Auto in the Final Edition , meaning techies will likely continue to be disappointed with this Evolution in that respect . How about safety tech such as automatic emergency braking , adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assistant systems ? Sorry , you wo n't find anything like that in the Evo , either . It 's too old -- in fact , you 'll note that this car wears a 2015 model year -- that 's not a misprint , Mitsubishi held over a particularly long model year to see this one through . Red accent stitching highlights the Lancer Evolution Final Edition's cabin . Nick Miotke / Roadshow Those looking for ride comfort and interior quality also need not apply . The noisy 18-inch Yokohama Advan A13 tires have cement-like sidewalls that yield a rough-and-tumble ride quality . If you 're expecting the suspension with Bilstein shock absorbers and Eibach springs to provide some damping relief , think again . There 's little give , meaning impacts from even small ruts transmit into the cabin and up your spinal cord . Since its 2008 launch , the Evo's interior has undergone a string of minor improvements . The center multi-information display is now color instead of all red , chrome accents dress the environment up some , and soft-touch upper door trims help break-up the acres of hard plastic up front . It 's a cabin that does n't look too out of place in an $ 18 , 000 compact economy sedan , but likely will disappoint many in a $ 39 , 000 machine . Got wing ? Even without a show-stopping interior , there 's no denying that the Evolution Final Edition looks the part on the outside . An aggressive front end , vented hood , wider front fenders and trademark shopping-cart rear wing are direct links to the car's World Rally Championship roots when driver Tommi Mäkinen notched four consecutive titles piloting Evolutions in the late 1990s . Some small styling alterations do set the Final Edition apart from regular Evos , with the most notable alteration being the black roof panel that contrasts nicely with this car's Diamond White paint . A black center bumper , hood vents , dark chrome grille trim and Enkei wheels complete the Final Edition touches outside . Even the spartan interior gets some Final Edition love , with red accent stitching , black headliner , sun visors , pillar trim and a numbered center console plaque denoting each car's place within the 1 , 600-unit limited-edition series . Disappointingly , the Recaro sport seats offered on some Evo models are n't part of this Final Edition package . While the basic chairs are comfortable and have respectable side bolstering , they do n't look like they belong in a model that is serving as the swan song to a noteworthy performance model . </doc>

1044,417,A1,"3 July 2003 CHILDREN DEPRIVED OF SPACE FOR ART , NEW REPORT FINDS The Clore Duffield Foundation publishes today Space for Art , the final report and recommendations based on a two year study of art-making and exploration spaces in schools , galleries and museums throughout the UK , on Children's Art Day , Thursday 3 July . Space for Art is a practical handbook for teachers and educators in galleries and museums , to help them fight for the kind of creative spaces they need . It highlights the lack of resources and attention to detail given to art-education spaces , with senior management and architects still failing to understand the practical requirements of such spaces . Sally Bacon , Director of the Clore Duffield Foundation , comments : "" I have been led round tiny spaces and been informed that a full class - in excess of 30 children - could work within them quite happily . Architects' drawings sometimes blithely reinforce this impossibility . We want gallery and museum staff to have some clear guidance on dimensions to prevent this state of affairs from carrying on . "" Space for Art explores the full range of issues surrounding such spaces , from the development process and working with architects to location and dimensions , storage and display , usage and management and services . Attention to detail and practical considerations are central to the success , or failure , of spaces . Too many educators have to fight for the basics : "" One room gained black-out facilities this summer , the other one still has n ' t ( 8 years of asking ) . "" Even temperature control is not a given : "" The children work with their coats on due to the cold and wash equipment and hands in cold water . Most of my time and energy is spent trying to change the environment . "" As one teacher sums it up : "" generally premises are not suitable for creativity . "" Technology and planning for change are vital issues , but despite significant recent investment in IT and ICT , many schools , galleries and museums still report inadequate provision . Access to the Internet in the vast majority of secondary school art education spaces is either restricted ( 69 % ) or impossible ( 24 % ) . Work with art-based software packages is also very limited ( 76 % ) or out of the question ( 18 % ) . Gallery educators report similar difficulties : almost three-quarters ( 72 % ) say that access to the Internet or working with art-based software is poor or restricted . Practice in primary schools is also restricted in photography ( 73 % ) , ceramics ( 63 % ) , and textiles ( 77 % ) . The report's findings and recommendations for the future are at the heart of the Clore Duffield Foundation's concerns as the founder of Children's Art Day and the creator of Artworks : Young Artists of the Year Awards , as well as a funder of education spaces within galleries and museums . PRESS ENQUIRIES ERICA BOLTON / JANE QUINN 020 7221 5000 Notes to Editors : Space for Art is the result of a two-year research project devised , managed and funded by the Clore Duffield Foundation as part of its Artworks programme . The project has been run in partnership with Arts Council England , the Department for Education and Skills ( DfES ) , the Heritage Lottery Fund , the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority ( QCA ) , and others . The Clore Duffield Foundation carried out a wide-ranging consultative exercise to gather data , experiences and opinions on the ideal art education space . This included a series of focus groups with gallery staff , art teachers , architects , artists and pupils ; a questionnaire sent to 2000 art teachers ; a questionnaire sent to 845 galleries and museums ; workshops with children ; focus groups with architects ( the latter organised and funded by Arts Council England ) as well as in-depth case studies of art education spaces in 11 schools and ten galleries , in consultation with managers and users of the spaces , including gallery educators , artists , teachers , pupils and architects . These case studies were drawn from across the UK and spanned national and local-authority galleries , and state , independent , early years , primary , secondary and special schools in urban and rural environments . The full text of all 21 case studies , along with the full Space for Art report and background material from the research , can be found in the research section of the Artworks website : www . a rt-works . o rg . u k .

1126,1635,A8,"Electrical engineers at the University of California , San Diego will lead a six-university effort to enable troops to set up mobile communications networks on the battlefield , using lightweight wireless equipment during commando raids and in other hostile and rapidly changing environments . The project to develop "" space-time processing for tactical mobile ad-hoc networks "" will receive approximately $ 3 million in funding over three years from the U.S. Department of Defense , which will have the option to extend funding to $ 5 . 25 million over five years . The project for the U.S. Army is one of 31 approved last week by DoD's Multidisciplinary Research Initiative ( MURI ) program , a $ 146 million , five-year effort targeting topics of "" exceptional opportunity "" for DoD technologies and applications . "" MURI topics have very aggressive technical goals for objectives that can not be accomplished with existing technologies , "" said James Zeidler , principal investigator on the project and a research scientist and senior lecturer in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of UCSD's Jacobs School of Engineering . "" We are developing some fundamentally new concepts and approaches , and it will be a very exciting project . "" Ad-hoc networks form when communications peers find each other without the benefit of centralized network control systems . Deployment is vastly more complicated in fluid tactical situations where special challenges emerge , and where the price of dropped communications can mean loss of life and mission failure . Among the difficulties : peers must stay in touch while having to move around , maintain stealth , and avoid enemy jamming and eaves-dropping attempts . The network must sustain itself when communications partners go out of range or are damaged or destroyed . Noted Zeidler : "" The technology could also be useful to firefighters , police , and other responders to emergencies such as fires , earthquakes , or terrorist attacks that have knocked out pre-existing communications infrastructure . "" Equipment that would be used in a tactical ad-hoc network ranges from mobile radios mounted in backpacks , laptops , and hand-held computers to antennae mounted on vehicles such as tanks and Humvees that come and go , and even airborne relays to route data to and from command and control bases and headquarters . New technology would improve wireless battlefield communi-cations for soldiers such as this U.S. Army paratrooper in Fallujah , Iraq , February 2004 . ( Photo Courtesy of U.S. Army ) One target of innovation for the project is the network protocol suite , a reference to the many programs used to manage communications . These typically are grouped into discrete steps or layers , an arrangement that robs a network of an ability to adapt to changing conditions . One goal of the project is to set up a cross-layer algorithm that will enable the different layers to join together in decisions , for example to decide to rotate an antenna in response to lagging signal strength , or to rapidly switch partners in response to movement . The team will also explore the use of new antenna technology , coding , and error-correction systems . One focus will be multiple-input / multiple-output ( MIMO ) devices endowed with multiple antennas . This is new technology that shows great potential for enabling communications in less than optimum circumstances . In a recent study by Brian Banister , one of Zeidler's graduate student researchers , a ten-fold boost in channel capacity was achieved using an eight-fold asymmetric MIMO channel compared to a one-way channel , given the same signal-to-noise ratios on each channel . MIMO devices format signals using space-time coding , where the receiver analyzes positional differences between pieces of a signal and the timing of the signal's arrival when decoding messages . The funding will support the work of faculty and graduate students on the UCSD campus , including at the Center for Wireless Communications ( CWC ) and the California Institute of Telecommunications and Information Technology [ Cal - ( IT ) 2 ] . Four Jacobs School electrical and computer engineering faculty will work with Zeidler on the project : Rene Cruz , Larry Milstein , John Proakis , and Bhaskar Rao . Research faculty at other locations include UC Irvine's Hamid Jafarkhani ; J.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves at UC Santa Cruz ; Yingbo Hua and Srikanth Krishnamurthy at UC Riverside ; as well as A. Lee Swindlehurst and Michael Jensen at Brigham Young University . Additional funding from the Canadian Defense Research establishment will underwrite research by professor Simon Haykin at McMaster University in Hamilton in Ontario , Canada . Michele Zorzi of the University of Padua , Italy has collaborated with Professors Cruz and Krishnamurthy on numerous publications in this technical area , and will also participate in this project as a visiting professor at UCSD . </doc>
